19852,"Sorry this review is long but I am worried my last review of - stars for this hotel is no longer timely.
We have stayed at this hotel before and returned because we loved it the last time. I booked my stay with an Omni gift certificate that I bought at a silent auction. After a few unreturned phone calls to various staff, I was told I could not pay to upgrade to one of their breakfast packages (those are a better deal). OK-no big deal-Just thought I would ask since we enjoyed the restaurant last time for breakfast each morning. (We are gold Starwood members and are accustomed to free breakfast in their club lounges. Hilton always gives us coupons for free breakfast too. Omni does free room service juice-coffee for its members but with kids it is hard to beat free continental breakfast in a club lounge.)
We arrived on Saturday night and checked in without incident. Our room was as lovely as last time. The big windows are very cool and the staff put us on the top floor where the view is great and the street noise is lessened-very nice.
Sunday am found us at the pool. We enjoy their pool on the roof of the -rd floor. It is such a nice place in the middle of downtown. We did notice all the kids had backpacks filled with toys. My kids kept asking why we didn’t get one. I don’t know? When we left the hotel for the day, we stopped by and asked at the front desk. OH, you didn’t receive one? They gave us some and a coupon for free kids meal (but only from -:-- to -:--) at the pool grill. We went out for the day, but promised the kids we would be back for hot dogs by the pool. We enjoyed the new Fort Woth Science Museum and IMAX (always - star) and had lunch at Fred’s (cute diner near downtown but not worth the Sunday brunch wait this time). We left the museum at -:-- and rushed back to the hotel for hot dogs. Wow, what a chore. My husband spent ----- minutes standing by the bar at the pool (and it is still hot in Sept in TX and there were no chairs) waiting on this one poor boy to make the kids meals. Then they ran out of chips and you had to stand in another line to get a drink he said. Not worth the effort at all. Plus it was so windy, we quickly lost one drink to the wind. I tried to get a refill but gave up after waiting for -- minutes at the bar. Why were they not prepared for all these kids? If you are going to pass out coupons for something easy like hot dogs for a - hour window, then grill up some hot dogs and buy some chips and pre-pour several Sprites. ANY mom who has organized a birthday party for -- kids knows how to do that. Don’t expect this one poor boy to do all of that himself. He looked like he was about to pull his hair out. The idea was good but the execution was poor and frustrating to everyone waiting. (We experienced a similar long wait the last time we ate at the pool grill but we were told it was just the Memorial Day crowd. This time, it was a holiday but there wasn’t really a crowd at all-several empty tables at -:-- pm.)
Our kids enjoyed the kids club next. They convert a large meeting room into a play area on the weekends during summer. They had a movie playing and a bounce house was new this time. The kids loved that. But hardly any kids were in there? I don’t think anyone knows about it.
The next morning I was awakened by my husband asking me what I wanted to do about my shoes. What are you talking about???? It turned out that before - am someone called our room (on Labor Day which is a US holiday and I was hoping to sleep in) to tell me that my shoes that I put out for a shoe shine at - pm on Sat (-- hours earlier) couldn’t be done unless they put white polish on my bone colored shoes. They wanted to know if I wanted them to use the wrong color? (Of course not.) I told them just to return the shoes. Great. Now I am wide awake and one of the kids is awake. Who calls a hotel room to wake up people regarding shoes by - am on a holiday? Crazy. Then they didn’t return my shoes as I asked. When I was in the kids club -.- hours later, I mentioned to the kids that we had to leave to go find my shoes that had been missing. A nice female employee offered to go find them for me. A bellman type man returned later with my shoes. (Why didn’t they timely put the shoe bag on my door with a nice note explaining they are out of polish—no big deal.)
When we checked out I mentioned to the front staff I did not appreciate the pre- -am phone call. A management-looking man stepped up and took full credit for calling me. (He seemed very proud of it for some crazy reason.) I appreciated the honesty (his Mom would be very proud) but explained I was trying to sleep in (which is priceless for working moms and which is part of why people check into hotels to not wake up at the normal time for school-work). He never apologized; he still though calling before - am was great customer service. I thought by politely telling him I disapproved he might not wake up any other poor mom on a holiday? I hope so. I do know I was looking at a sheet of paper with some notes on it when I was talking to him. He asked me for the paper. I told him it was just notes but I gave it to him thinking maybe someone would contact us later? It has been over a month now and no one has ever called. So now I am starting to wonder if maybe he wanted to keep the paper so no one else saw it? Who knows. Perhaps he doesn't have kids or a wife so he is clueless about my concern?
We had another issue regarding room service being an hour late (we called them to ask if they were coming at all and they didn’t seem to know about our order we hung on our door the night before) but they resolved the issue by taking $-.-- off the bill after the I explained the waiter told me the tip was not included (so I tipped him) and it was actually included. I would tell you not to order the $- croissants off the room service menu. I actually took a picture of one of them since it was barely larger than a sugar packet. It was almost a joke to my hungry kids. But it really didn’t matter since they were so stale-chewy that the kids would not even eat them.
We really like this hotel for several reasons (new, great pool and centrally located to all the activities in Fort Worth) and we will probably will go back but I was just disappointed by the service this time. Over --% of the time we asked them to do something (other than provide a room), staff did not execute well. They have a great free kids club but they don’t advertise it. Other hotels give you a schedule of events when you check in so you can plan accordingly. (I mentioned this when we checked out and was told there was a schedule in the backpack. We looked (thinking we must have missed it) but neither backpack included a schedule.) This hotel is just so so close to being really great. We hope on our next visit they will have these kinks worked out. We enjoy Omni’s a lot and the price at this one is very reasonable for a weekend getaway. We are hoping it was just an off weekend for them. Lots of North Texas area families would love this hotel for a staycation if they can work out the kinks. It takes first rate service to make guests want to come back. A pretty new hotel is not enough.",1,"sorry review long worry last review star hotel longer timely.

First the pros: The location of the hotel is excellent, in Times Square, near the theaters and the red stairs. Since our arrival, the service is excellent. From the bellman, to the check in personnel, all do their best to help and please you. 
When I check out, I forgot my camera (with the photos of my two weeks road trip) over the bed. I called at -:--AM to notify the hotel. They transfer me to security. I explained the situation and they told me that they will verify my room and keep my camera. An hour later I called back and they told me they already had my camera in the security area; they explained me the process to send it back to me, and asked for my information to send it back. The same day, the security manager sent me an email asking for my confirmation for the shipping charges. A couple of days after I received my camera in Puerto Rico. Thomas Chestnaro, the security manager, was super attentive!! He managed the situation in an outstanding way, and for my complete satisfaction.
Now the cons: The room was horrible. The carpet in the aisles and the room was dated and dirty. The sheets of the beds were old and ugly. The bathroom had an awkward design. The toilet almost block the access to the bathroom. When you open the bathroom door, you trip into the toilet. There was no space in the bathroom to hang the towels nor to put your toiletteries. The tub and the tiles had lime. The tub was clogged and kept the water used by my husband and two girls. When they cleaned the room, they only emptied the tub, just to be filled again when we took the next shower. The beds were uncomfortable. You could feel the springs of the mattresses. There were electric or phone cables exposed in one corner of the room. The air conditioner was super noisy. The hotel only have one ice machine on floor - for the whole hotel. Unless you went to pick ice at -am, you will not find any ice. I definitively will no go back to this hotel.

At $--- (the negotiated room rate for our party) I felt the value was good for the location. The room was nice, but didn't have some things that are important to me - thus the average rating. I missed having a refrigerator. There was a small chair but I would have liked a more significant chair or sofa to relax in. The room was very dark.

The bathroom was great with a soaking tub and rainfall shower (separate). Though it may not work for a family as there was no curtain on the tub and the stall had a glass door - so no privacy if someone else is using the sink or passing through to the toilet. My BIG issue was the valet parking. We checked out at noon, which I understand is a busy time. However, after I handed over my ticket and waited a bit one of the valets came over with two keys and paperwork and asked me if one of the cars was mine (it wasn't). I told him what kind of car I had. A few minutes later the experience was repeated by another valet.

25076,My husband and live in San Diego but we do not have a swimming pool so decided to go to a hotel in San Diego for - days to get away from the house and use the swimming pool. The Pearl has a salt water pool and so that is why I chose this hotel. We never did use the pool because it feels like your in a fish bowl. The hotel is U shaped with the pool in the center. The restaurant-bar is open and facing toward the pool and people sitting around the pool at the restaurant-bar seats and tables. No one was in the pool. We ate at the restaurant once. The food came beautifully prepared and delicious but the portions are quite small and pricey. The choice of items on the menu are not those of your everyday restaurants. The decor in the room is modern and selected to make good use of the tiny space (see my photos). Our room sat at the back on the second floor and seemed quiet enough and clean. There is not much room to hang or store your clothes and the shower stall is small. The bed was comfortable but felt a little bit short of a queen size. In the photo the bed looks really small because it is made-up from side to side and not from head to toe but you just move the pillows to sleep long way. We usually could find a place on the street to park but had to walk a couple of blocks which is not problem for us.,1,husband live san diego swim pool decide go hotel san diego day get away house use swim pool pearl salt water pool choose hotel never use pool feel like fish bowl hotel shape pool center restaurant-bar open face toward pool people sit around pool restaurant-bar seat table one pool ate restaurant food come beautifully prepared delicious portion quite small pricey choice item menu everyday restaurant decor room modern select make good use tiny space see photos room sit back second floor seem quiet enough clean much room hang store clothes shower stall small bed comfortable felt little bit short queen size photo bed look really small made-up side side head toe move pillow sleep long way usually could find place street park walk couple block problem,0.36798906,0.05478028,-0.3608665,-0.078056954,0.8329793,-0.22230121,0.86687416,0.20266214

I'll start with the good:
** The hotel lobby and rooms are high-quality with respect to construction, decoration and style - I would consider it a --star in this department.
** It's in a great location if you need access to the financial district, or if you'd like to spend an evening in the Italian-influenced North Beach area which has plenty of great restaurants and clubs. It's literally located --- blocks from North Beach, so its an easy walk and you don't even need a cab.
Now for the bad:
** From the front door to the front desk, bellman to desk clerk to valet, the staff is totally mediocre.
** Beware of the guest rooms that end in -- (e.g. ----). They are miniature versions of the regular guestrooms that barely fit one full-sized bed (yes, smaller than a queen). The bath room is also much smaller - it can barely fit a small sink with virtually no counter space (no place for toothpaste here), a toilet and the shower. The shower head is way too low - literally at chest level on me (I'm not that tall). Our window had nice views, however, it upheld the miniature theme and occupied only about --% of the outward facing wall. These rooms are also right next to the elevator which you can hear when in use, and across the hall from the ice machine and vending. Luckily I was extremely tired when we retired to the room from a long night out, so it didn't bother me too much.
** The valet parking cost is exorbitant at $--.-- + $-.-- tax for a total of $--.-- per night! When I arrived I just figured, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sure, valet it - how much can it be, --?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Buyer beware, I should have asked. It especially burns when you get poor service and you paid more than top-dollar for it. I'd recommend trying to self-park unless you have money to burn.

12637,"I had a great stay at the Wyndham Garden Chelsea. I was there in June ---- for a weekend event, and many of the other participants were staying there.
I stayed in one of the two-room suites with two other people. It was a perfect setup, and has a balcony with an amazing city view. We were originally booked into a regular two-bed room, but front desk offered me a two-room suite at a good rate, so we took it instead. What a great decision.
Upon arrival into the room, I was concerned about sleeping on the pull-out because the mattress did not look very comfortable, but I called front desk and almost immediately, a very pleasant young lady came to install a foamy on the pull-out. She was very nice to chat with, and was meticulous in setting up the bed with the foamy. I tipped her about $- for the good work.
Me and the other people in the room were going to switch between the King bed in the bedroom and the pull-out on a nightly basis, but the pull-out ended up being so comfortable with the foamy, I just kept it for myself the entire stay.
The suites are pricy, but it is Manhattan, and when the cost is split, its great value. The only issues I had with the suites were minor: A lamp in the mainroom wasn’t working very well; The light on the outside balcony wasn’t working (the balcony was very dark at night). Also note, the washroom is accessible through the bedroom. A couple of stools on the balcony wouldn’t hurt either.
I will concur with other reviewers that the lobby is small, so if you are looking for a “mix and mingle” lobby, this lobby isn’t for you. But the patio in front of the restaurant outside is an excellent alternative to see and be seen at this hotel, with reasonable prices on wine. Also, I never had a problem with slow service in the lobby, but the potential for slow service may exist because there are only two stations at the check-in desk. When seeking information and asking questions at front desk, I had good, polite experiences with staff.
One of the strengths of the location is not only that it is right downtown, but its far enough from all the madness of Broadway, Times Square, etc. that you get the quiet you want, but close enough that any of the good stuff is just a few minutes away! Its right in the centre of a fairly quiet street block, so there’s no noisy traffic from the avenues keeping you up all night.

24360,"I travel ALOT. Meaning I am in hotels a minimum of - - -- days a month, sometimes -- days a month. I probably spend more a month on hotel cost than I do on my mortgage. So with this in mind, I am a consumer who understands the workings of a good hotel. I know the industry standards so to speak and what to expect.
I knew that the room would be small. It's a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""boutique"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" style hotel, small is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""standard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in NYC. The room was a little bigger than I had expected, but still small. The bathroom was larger than I expected, I've been in ones that you actually had to out your knees into the shower stall to use it, so this one was pleasantly accommodating for the price.
The bed and pillows were actually incredibly comfortable and very comfortable to sleep in. 
I was disappointed that there was no desk, no chair, and no outlets to be used near the bed. In this day of cell phones an outlet near the bed is a mandatory item.
The was no outlet near the sink, making doing hair an obstacle, as it was several feet away from the mirror. There was no bathmat, so when you got out you had to be very careful to not slip on the floor with wet feet.
No washcloths. No mini bat. No ice bucket. And the IPods dock alarm clock could not be set.
All of these things I could deal with for the price point.
BUT, I have been aching to try this hotel, as I fell in love with the online photos of a beautiful lobby, and bar- lounge area.
The lobby is under construction and has no appeal what so ever, although I will give them points for the lemon ice water available. 
The lounge area was ok. I loved the bar area. It was what I had hoped for and my server was gracious and knowledgeable not only of drinks but in suggestions.
Everything was acceptable enough for me that I extended my stay one night. To do so they had me check out and check back in, although this was odd as I had to do it online. Originally I made my reservations online with a debit card, when I checked out I paid with cash and was told the room charges and incidental charges - which I am clueless as to why they do this since they have no mini bar, no hotel robes.... I was told over the phone the incidental hold would be -- dollars, when I got there they put a -- dollar hold on my card.
So I have paid cash for my first nights stay so I have been told specifically that the hold on my credit card of --- dollars would be immediately released. Great.
So I check in for my second night stay and pay for the stay upfront with cash, including the incidental charge, which will be returned to me upon check out. No big deal.
This hotel is not really convenient to my business in the city as I have an industry function to attend down on Varrick Street, which is quite a hike, even by cab or subway, but at the price point, it is acceptable, even though the lobby is under construction, which they do not tell you prior to booking, and seems a little deceiving....
In other words, the only reason I booked here was because this was a hotel I wanted to check out because of it's lobby and the library bar, and with the price, I thought now was the time to do so. It hasn't been a wonderful or notable venture, but nothing so far that would make me avoid it in the future. Hotel management, take note to that, as of that point, you could have been assured of possible repeat business with a very frequent traveler, that is mire valuable in any business than anything else.... as to constantly try to get new customers through advertising dollars becomes very expensive, when all you have to do is maintain a certain standard once you have a guest to get them to come back.....
Before I check out I get onto my IPad and log in to my bank account and notice that my funds have not yet been released???? Hmmmm..... 
When I get to the front desk to check out I inquire as to why the hold is still on my bank account, and am told, that the hold was immediately taken off the moment I originally checked out, -- hours prior, and that it must be my bank..... which I know is untrue. I travel too much and always use the same debit card for my travels, and have seen in nearly --% of the hotels that I have stayed at, that the moment I check out, the hold is released, and the money back available for my use within an hour. 
Once I leave, I call my bank to get the REAL facts, I have been dealing with them for years, I have a good relationship with them, while this is my first dealings with this hotel, and my bank, which is the one I use for all of my travel bookings, informs me that the hotel has never contacted them AT ALL TO RELEASE MY FUNDS, AND THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PUT A HOLD ON MY MONEY FOR -, YES, FIVE DAYS!
I had specifically inquired when I checked out the first day and opted to pay them with cash if the release would be done immediately, I was assured that the minute they checked me out from my original reservation that it would be done that moment. When I checked out the second day I again inquired and was again assured that it happened immediately when I had checked out the day before.
They never released the hold, my bank was NEVER contacted at all, except to put a hold for - business days. This is unacceptable on every level. If they had been honest with me from the start I would have simply left the room on my debit card and not paid them in cash, so now I am out --- dollars until they decide to honor their contractually legal obligation, which was to release the hold immediately upon my check out from my original reservation.
They falsely advertise their hotel in the depiction of the hotels photos, if it's under construction this should be made aware to the guest, as it is the ONLY reason I wanted at stay at this hotel, as there are hundreds of other hotels in this city to try, and they have in an essence stolen my money. 
And they can try to state that this is industry standard, but I travel enough to know better. They can try to blame my bank, but I have been using my bank for years, and have never had any issues with them releasing my funds, EVER, and the fact remains, I was told specifically that they released the hold and my bank has been very clear to me that they were NEVER contacted by the hotel to release my funds, only to hold them and this has caused me great inconvenience, and if I had been told the truth from the start, I would have opted to have kept the charge on my debit card and not paid them with cash..... thank God that I had enough money on me to be able to afford to pay for my travel arrangements to get home.

We chose the Hudson hotel near the Columbus Circle area. Everything about our stay was perfect, it made our first Valentine's together that more memorable. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon at -pm. We were helped by Hudson Regional Guest Experience Manager, Ms. Shacazia Brown. She was very pleasant, knowledgeable and all smiles upon our arrival. She made us feel very welcomed and seemed thankful about having our business. We were checked into our room within - minutes. She gave us a brief tour of the hotel's Library Bar, Hudson Bar and Restaurant area. She knew in advance that is was a special romantic weekend and presented us with chocolates and a bottle of champagne in our deluxe studio room.

After we returned from dinner, we had reservations at the Library Bar near a fireplace. It was such a romantic setting for celebrating our love. We relaxed for an hour and went back to our room to freshen up. We had --pm reservations at the Hudson bar and were seated immediately. The DJ played great tunes all night as we sipped champagne, ate strawberries and danced. The party was filled with people of all different ages and cultures. It was nice to be in a different atmosphere for a change. We ended the night sleeping like babies in our comfortable bed. The next morning we had breakfast at Hudson's beautiful rustic style restaurant. The breakfast selection was divine and my palate was extremely satisfied.

Valet service was friendly and efficient. They seemed to like our Hertz Mustand GT!
Desk clerks Seth and John get a special mention as they both were very helpful in giving us directions and great day trip ideas. One morning I came downstairs to the lobby very early, before the coffee was out, and John gratiously went out of his way to get me a fresh cup that he made himself. Seth gave us great ideas for a trip to Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. These 'extras' made an already nice trip even more special. 
An area of improvement is in what I call 'mechanics.' We actually stayed in two different rooms and in both cases the in room coffee maker did not work. In the second room the exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn't working and I reported this to maintenance. It was awknowledged but nothing was done and we were in the second room - nights, and the first for - nights. I rate these issues as fairly 'minor' and not enough to seriously detract from an otherwise very nice stay. But management can and should correct these items.

37210,"My sister had to visit NYC on business and asked me to join her. She knows I visit NYC frequently and wanted me along to show her the town. Her company had booked her in the Algonquin because it was directly across the street from the offices where she was scheduled to teach seminars. We changed the reservation from a single to a twin and asked for an early check-in, - PM versus the - PM official check-in, and were assured they'd do their best to accommodate that. 
We arrived shortly after - PM and our room was not ready, and the front desk would only tell us that they would """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""try"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to get it done earlier, but that we should not expect it before - PM, and that they could not even estimate when the room might be ready. Hmmm.... So we checked our bags and went out to kill two hours. We returned after - PM and were shown to our room. The bell staff were, by the way, excellent. The front desk staff were usually chatting with each other and acted annoyed when they were interrupted to deal with a guest.
I stay in NYC, midtown, frequently. I have never seen such a tiny room for that price. There were two beds (way too soft for both our preferences, and I like a soft bed), a small night table which was already completely covered with a lamp and a phone, a very small desk, mostly occupied with promotional material and another lamp, and a tiny closet, made even tinier by the safe, telephone book, ironing board, and iron already crammed in there. Not a drawer anywhere to put anything except the one in the tiny night table, which already contained the requisite Gideon bible. There was hardly enough space around the beds to navigate without hitting a wall or furniture. And because we had to live out of our suitcases (since there was nowhere to put our things except the tiny closet), and the suitcases had to sit on luggage stands, that meant even less space. We were on the -th floor, directly across from an office building, and the street noise (especially when they pick up the garbage late at night, every night, from the hotel's restaurants) was pretty loud.
The bathroom was similarly tiny (sensing a theme here?), with a narrow shelf over the toilet already covered with the kleenex and the complementary toiletries (from some Australian company I've never heard of). Another narrow, short shelf was over the sink. That completed the bathroom storage. We've got two women here for three days. You can imagine we were thrilled there was nowhere to put any toiletries at all. Additionally, there was a dark brown, nasty something in the toilet. When we complained, politely, to the front desk, a very nice maintenance man came right up, worked on the toilet a few minutes, asked for our phone, and contacted the front desk to ask them to give us another room. Sadly, they had no other twins available, or so they said. The maintenance guy did the best he could, but the toilet was disgusting the entire stay and never flushed properly. We were never offered any discount or even an apology by the front desk for the problem.
The A-C (it was extremely hot and humid in NY during our stay) was very loud. The free WiFi in the room was spotty and s-l-o-o-o-w. There was no coffee maker (besides, where would you put it?), and the free coffee in the lobby was only available up to - AM, at which time it promptly disappears. No coincidence that - AM is when their restaurant opens. Room service only provides liquor and breakfast, and that's it.
The good news is the gym on the -rd floor, which is reasonably well equipped and FREE. We used it every day. Also, Matilda, the resident kitty, is a nice touch. And housekeeping was unobtrusive and thorough. Sheets on the bed were high quality.
We never ate at the restaurants, but were not very impressed by the menu choices and felt the prices were inordinately high. You can do much better with so many restaurants not far from the hotel. Red Flame is great for breakfast or other diner-type choices. Monster Sushi is a couple of blocks north, DB Moderne is two doors down (if you want to spend more), etc.
Frankly, we would never stay here again. For the money, you get nicer, larger rooms, more concerned front desk staff, and many more amenities at the Muse, Michelangelo, San Carlos, Benjamin, Warwick, Doubletree, or just about anyplace else I have ever stayed midtown.",1,"sister visit nyc business ask join know visit nyc frequently want along show town company book algonquin directly across street office schedule teach seminar change reservation single twin ask early check-in pm versus pm official check-in assure they'd best accommodate

As for the insane negative reviews that you may see - 
-) the staff is incredibly polite. No one was EVER snotty or ignored us. Everyone went out of their way to help us. 
-) this is not a hotel for children. If you have lots of kids, go to Disneyland, not a hot, beautiful, trendy hotel, that caters to professionals.
-) it is very easy to find your room, the elevators, and everything else. The hotel is 
very easy to navigate

It started badly when the concierge desk did not return my voice mail asking for sightseeing recommendations to book before my arrival. I therefore had to go with information gleaned from the internet instead of from a local expert.

I could not sleep well because the bed was so worn out at the edges that I kept feeling I was falling out of bed. The shower stall was tiny, even by European standards. The club room offerings were meager and it was less expensive to buy a beer at the lobby lounge than at cocktail time in the club room.

6418,"The Holiday Inn on --th St. is so new that some cab driver did not even know it existed until we gave them directions to the hotel. It's a tall and slender hotel surprisingly in a quiet street between Chelsea and the Flatiron District. 
 As many travelers have commented on past reviews the lobby and rooms are small. However, there is a bar and restaurant that provides a larger space to socialize away from busy crowds in the lobby. I was amazed by the friendly service the front desk provided even with people crowding at the desk wanting to check in, check out, ask for directions, and complain. The employees are able to handle such stress and maintain a friendly smile throughout the craziness. 
 We stayed on the --th floor wtih a view of --th street. The double beds were really comfortable, but as other travelers stated, the rooms were fairly small. The bathroom itself had a tiny sink, but four people were able to manage a weekend in this tiny room without any issue. I did not hear any noise coming from the hallway since some of the doors to the rooms are tucked in small hallways. As far as the elvator situation, we really had no issue waiting between the two in the building. It ran up and down quite fast so there was no issue having to wait for a long time. This elevator is in comparison to The Pod, which unfortunately ran slow and was smaller. We had drinks at the bar and the people there are so friendly and will make you some strong drinks. However, it was pricey like all other bars in NYC. 
 The neighborhood is really interesting since it is mixed with tourist, straight, and gay people around. On -th street lies FIT and Martha Stewart's studio and on -th street lies your CVS and Starbucks. The subway are on --th and --rd street, but would reccomend --rd street since its busier around the Flatiron Building and provides multiple tracks (RWFV). Cheap breakfast can be found at A Taste of NYC on --rd and -th (literally eggs,sausage, and hash brown for under $-). After hours dinner and good dessert is on --rd at Malibu Diner. There is a bar next door to the hotel, but there is also Rogue around the corner. This bar felt like the employees were snobby so we didn't go there again. 
 If this is the new look for Holiday Inn, then I definately agree they have stepped up to a level of competition with Hilton, Sheraton, and Radisson. This hotel was very comfortable even with small rooms, the bed was amazing. Its ambience and exceptional customer service made the place bigger than it really was for a weekend stay in NYC. The neighborhood is far enough from the crowds of Time Square, but close enough to see the lights on the corner of -th and --th. I definately would stay here again since the neighborhood offers all nearby attractions without the noise and crowds of NYC.

The Erwin Hotel was a great introduction to the JDV way, it's chic and stylish but still affordable.

The check in area was a little cramped, but the check-in process was very quick and soon we were up in our room. The room was fairly basic but it was roomy and had plenty of modern charm. The restaurant is cozy but they have good healthy food. One unexpected bonus was the sunglasses they had for sale in the room, we needed a pair so grabbed one and paid when we checked out. 
The rooftop bar is remarkable and the true highlight of the hotel. We went up on a weekday afternoon and there were only a couple other tables occupied so we more or less had it to ourselves. Unbeatable views of the coast. The one drawback of the rooftop bar, as other reviews have noted, is that if your room is near the elevator or stairway that gives access to it, it will be noisy during peak bar times (weekend nights).

The hotel has a great downtown location as you are a short walk from varied places to eat and tourist destinations of Dallas. You also have easy access to the interstate for traveling to other destinations, because of this quick access it was a great location for us to travel to Cowboys Stadium. 
The front desk staff was very helpful and the public areas of the hotel are well taken care of. The valet was a major issue for us. Not once when we went down to valet did they check the ticket to make sure we were leaving with our car. This is completely unacceptable in my mind because anyone could have driven off with someone’s car. (Be mindful when booking that there is a fee of $-- per day for valet.)
The hotel bed was comfortable, but the room could have used an updated paint job, a window cleaning, updated décor and furniture and some of the outlets did not work. In addition, the soaps and lotions that were supplied had less than appealing smells; they reminded us of the smell in a nursing home.

17433,"Fellow members,
The wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and Suites Fisherman's Wharf in early July. I believe there is another Holiday Inn Express on Fishermen's Wharf, but this review is for Holiday Inn Express and SUITES. The location is excellent for the Wharf experience. Lots of shops, restaurants, and a wonderful view. The breakfast is very adequate, what you usually get at Holiday Inn.
There were a few issues with this property, which may or may not have been taken care of. For a large hotel, I would expect more than - elevators, and since one was not working this made for some long wait time. The remote on our TV did not always work, so you used the controls on the front. None of these items are deal breakers.
My biggest problem was the valet parking. Upon arrrivng there was a large sign 'Valet parking $-- per night', which was a real surprise. Their website did not mention the cost for parking and I found this to be abusive. Add tax and the parking for one day was over $--. The attendant said there wasn't much choice for the area (what else could he say). Not knowing there was an outdoor lot one-half block away that would have saved a bunch I paid the fee.
The cable cars are only one block from the hotel, but the line was soon long (probable one hour +), we walked to China town, about one and one half miles.
The hotel in general was just OK, but add the outrageous parking and I would suggest you can do better. Maybe the financial district and then walk to various spots of interest.

I arrived after flying for -.- hours. I was exhausted and quite chilly. Before I knew it I had a down comforter on my bed which was much more comfortable for me because that's what I have at HOME! I wanted to pick up a couple items and the front desk first called to see if they could book the Acura Experience for me (unavail). That would have been fun but I actually wanted to walk! I ordered a sandwhich in the Living Room and it was far too greasy for my taste. I think I just generally expected a Turkey sandwhich to be a healthy option. I was probably too jet-lagged to read the description properly - there was cheese and bacon too. LOL The Living Room took care of me when I woke up groggy on the hunt for coffee and breakfast and later on I found the cobb salad was pretty delicious. They were also fantastic while we spent time socializing inside and on the terrace with business partners. I slept like a baby and felt pretty well rested even having displaced myself by - time zones for just a few days complete with a hectic schedule. The beds are wonderful! The Bliss spa products are great. Next time I stay at a W I know I can pack a bit less! There are lots of different snacks and drinks available which is quite convenient. The internet connection in the room was - star. And I personally really got to experience the WONDERFUL of the W. Room service arrived with two bottles of bubbly and fruits dipped in chocolate...and I knew it had to be a mistake...I insisted it was a mistake which it was. A little while later the guy came back with one bottle and plat for fruits dipped in chocolate and a note from the W saying this time it WASN'T a mistake. The gesture made me smile from ear-to-ear.

When my SIL & I both went to book it, the rate ended up even lower than quoted, a nice bonus! The rooms were large enough, I've been in some very small rooms in NYC, and the bath quite roomy. When we reserved, we were told that it would be in the older section, but we were placed in the newer section. Even though we were only on the third floor, the room was exceptionally quiet, no street noise at all. There was even a mini-frig in the room (empty, no mini bar, all for our use - perfect for families). The room was clean and neat, and the beds comfortable enough, not lush like a hotel twice the price, but again, a good value.
When we walked back from Times Square, we were happy to see how close we were. The out of the way hotel wasn't out of the way at all! And a bonus was the $-- parking that the hotel offered. Many times we've gone to a hotel where it costs a fortune to park your car.

There was a ceiling fan and light and a desk lamp next to the bed, along with a clock radio.

Doing so meant that we had occasional noise from people on the street below and delivery trucks pulling up at - AM, but it certainly did not detract from the experience of sleeping with the windows open. On our last night, the temperature reached into the upper --s, so we used the AC and heard not a single sound from the outside.
Our room rate of $--- per night was very reasonable. The neighborhood reminded us of NYC's Greenwich Village. We always felt safe. People were out on the streets at all hours.
The breakfast is ample, with juices, bagels, muffins, pastries, three kinds of cereal, fruit, hard-cooked eggs, yogurt, fresh grapefruit, and good coffee and teas. We enjoyed eating and drinking from nice stoneware mugs, plates, and bowls as well as stainless steel flatware... a welcome, civilized touch after the chain hotels which normally provide breakfast using flimsy plastic plates, styrofoam cups, and brittle plastic knives and forks. The breakfast area was constantly replenished and kept clean and tidy.
We found that dining out in Philadelphia was considerably more expensive than in Columbus, so we ate many meals in the local pub restaurants.

Within the hour we had settled and found our new home for the next - days... 
 Despite the obvious attractions of -th Avenue and New York City being right on your doorstep the St. Regis old world elegant charm very quickly took hold and we were reluctant to spend much of our - day visit away from the venue! The St. Regis is an experience that everyone should STOP to enjoy! By all means, on a tourist visit to New York - perhaps stay in another cheaper standard - star Hotel as a base for day trips (eg. Waldorf Astoria, & Times Square Marriot was also nice and great locations) - but factor into your visit a couple of nights at this more exclusive venue to allow the opportunity to stop and relax in New York City away from the crowds and the traffic and the hustle and bustle of life.
Do as we did and save the extra funds required -and splurge on the experience. Sip Champange for Breakfast, visit the day spa, enjoy the room service, appreciate the twice daily servicing of your room by house-keeping, the turndown service, the daily complimentary delivery of fresh roses and fruit & pastry platters, and enjoy the friendly but non obtrusive pampering from the hotel service staff, 
At the end of our booked stay we reluctantly checked out to transfer over to the Waldorf Astoria. During dinner that evening we reviewed our St.Regis Experience and realized we now had answered the question commonly asked by family members and friends who had learnt of the cost of our booking - , """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Why would you spend so many thousands of dollars on - nights of accomodation at a Hotel? (Aus $---- per night) How can it possibly be worth it?? """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" As we sadly farewelled the St. Regis - the answer was a clear and unaminous YES it was worth it! Every Aussie Dollar was well spent! It wasn't really any longer so much a question of whether this famous Hotel was worth it but rather - more the statement that WE are worth it!
EVERYONE deserves and should take the opportunity to experience such a luxurious escape from the reality of daily living.
So Save up for an experience that will give you a taste of life at a higher level... As one of my friends commented - """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I felt really uncomfortable when I arrived....not being used to such luxury and over the top 'Tiffany silver service!' - On departure her comment was - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I now feel so different - very comfortable with Chandeliers in the bathroom! This experience has made me feel like a Princess, stretched my comfort Zone, my expectations and desire to achieve-I now feel like I could own the place!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
That made it Worth it! - Having had but a small taste of lifestyles of the 'Rich and Famous"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - might just help propel these - young single Aussie girls on to greater levels of personal & career success- Because we have now developed the taste for the finer things in life !

The interior has a luxuorius feel and our room was clean and well decorated. Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, (or as the locals like to call it: Frisco. Just kidding, they HATE the nickanme: Frisco.)
Being the lushes that we are, my wife and I took full advantage of the free happy hour, arriving promptly at five, and not leaving until six. The bartenders were always very friendly and never gave us a hard time about our repeated trips for refills.
Probably the best feature of the Tuscan Inn is its location. With a very short - block walk, you are in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. Renting bikes and riding them over the Golden Gate bridge is especially fun. Around the corner from the hotel, the trolley ride is beautiful.

However, on my recent stay Apr -----, ----, the property was showing some operations problems. The front desk was sparsely manned - so even in the 'Elite' line, the wait was long. Then the credit card machine was not working, so I had to fill out a paper form (not even a terminal to key in info). But worse - the electronic key machine was not functioning. That required a wait at the bell desk for -- mins for a security approved staff member to escort me to my room to let me in, then a return trip to the front desk much later to get actual entry keys. 
Room service wait was long. The prices were even higher than usual. Breakfast was $-- for an omelet with toast, coffee and juice.

Location across street from UN, near Grand Central.
Safe neighborhood.
Great views of Midtown or the East River.
Clean rooms.
Fairly quiet area at night--not much traffic and honking.
Close enough to walk to restaurants or take the M-- bus up -st Ave. to even more.
Bad:
No express checkout, and only two clerks in the mornings.
Huge windows and inadequate blinds let in too much light too early in the morning.
Thin walls.
Weak air conditioning in some rooms.
Old-school TV with annoying noisy channel-changer.
No mirror outside the bathroom.
Bathroom lightswitch is outside the bathroom--no late-night trips without waking your bedmate.
Towels not the fluffiest.
Section of window in front of couch actually slides open--beware if you have children, who could easily fall out.
Conclusion:
Clean, safe, adequate, and convenient--but don't expect luxury or attention to detail, and be prepared for some odd quirks. The hotel very much seems to have been designed for budget-conscious foreign diplomats.
The Millennium UN is an adequate hotel. I have no horror stories to tell. Yet there were a host of minor annoyances. First was when I tried to lower the massive shade covering the massive window; I merely pulled on it, and the whole contraption fell down. Maintenance had to reinstall it. Could've been a lawsuit, had it hit me on the head and had I been the lititgious sort. It could've really injured an elderly person.
I later saw that the smoke alarm was hanging open, sans battery. The maintenance man later replaced the battery and told me smokers often pull it out--despite the fact that the hotel has tons of smoking rooms. He said it's hard to enforce the no-smoking rule in the other rooms. Is it? Other hotels have a note threatening you with a cleaning fee if they detect smoking. Whatever--a nonworking smoke detector in a hotel full of chain-smoking Chinese diplomats is a bit worrisome.
Even more worrisome: the sliding panel in the huge window. The panel is right above the back of the couch. It's easily big enough for a child to crawl through and fall to his-her death. What were they thinking?
I had stayed in another room of this hotel a couple of weeks before, and its a-c unit was fine. But in this room, the a-c--even on full blast--was piddling. I had the maintenance guy come up; he made an admirable effort, but for naught. I wasn't sweating--and lowering the shade helped a lot during the day--but it wasn't the -- degrees I prefer in August.
I could hear the conversation of the people in the next room from the bathroom--and I could understand every word. Inside the room itself--near the window--I could hear talking, but not loudly.
Even the TV was a bit odd. It was an old convex-screen model, and the channel changer made this very annoying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""thwack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sound with every channel change. I know that complaint may sound ridiculously picayune, but believe me--it got old fast.
And why is the bathroom lightswitch on the outside--like in Japan? If I make a trip early in the morning, I'd rather keep the light off till I have the door shut so I don't wake my wife. But with the switch on the outside, I can't do that.
If you stay here, give yourself extra time to check out, because there will be a crowd, and they only have two front-desk clerks.
The Millennium isn't a bad hotel--but it's not a great one. If you can get a good discount and you're prepared for the quirks, it's probably worth it. (Government rate is currently $----night.)",0,"good:

 the shades on the window(facing center) were a bit shady. I felt like I could see into other pod's as well as other pods look into my pod. Just have to fix the shade just right so as to feel like you have privacy. The problem is the AC. AC ran fine, I lucked out that it wasn't that hot, but if I had to close my shade and run the AC I think that would have been difficult. You would need to keep the shade open. I liked the fact that there was a (tiny) sink in the room. So I could take a shower in the shared bathroom and finish getting ready in my room. The shared bathroom was decent. Though there was always a musky smell. If you are taller than - feet -- inches, yeah the shared bathroom will probably be uncomfortable for you. The shared bathroom situation is decent. Only one person at a time. And there was always one available while I was there. It was a concern before but fine.

There wasn't alot of other people staying during that time, and it was nice because alot of the time we felt we had the place almost to ourselves. There was a convention there of some sort for a couple of days, but other than that it was pretty quiet. Never ate at the restaurant there...it was very expensive! We did sit one night and have a few drinks there, which was nice. The lush landscaping makes you feel like you're somewhere tropical. The ducks & parrots around are pretty cool too. The jacuzzi near the pool was one of the best features I thought! It was huge! Almost every nite we would go down to the pool area, and we practically had it all to ourselves! It was a nice way to end the day of sightseeing and to soothe our tired bodies. The bike rental shop is right there next to the hotel, which was convenient, as that's one of the things you have to do while there! It was alot of fun. We took the public transit instead of renting a car. The bus stop is right in front of the hotel, and for $- you ride all day on the city buses and they take you everywhere! Old Towne, Gaslamp & the zoo! Also, the San Diego transit website makes it very easy to navigate your way around the city. It saved us a TON of money! The hotel charges you extra for parking a car everyday. The one downside was that our room did not have a mini-fridge, which I thought it would. So we ended up buying a cheap cooler to keep drinks-snacks in our room. The hotel is so convenient to stores, shops & the beach, you really can just walk everywhere- and the fact that they have their own private beach is really nice. Although we didn't eat at the restaurant there, we must have tried almost every restaurant in a - mile radious! It was alot of fun, and I would definitely go again.

22809,"Here' s a review of the hotel from two perspectives: one from a person who was in L.A. on a - week business trip (my husband) and one who was in L.A. on vacation for - days (me). 
The W Hollywood is a beautifully designed hotel with spacious, modern rooms. The clientelle tends to be primarily in their --'s and --'s (with a lot of money to spend it seems as this is not an inexpensive hotel). 
The hotel's Drai nightclub is a major draw and there lies the problem in trying to get a good night's sleep. Nightly at about - AM when the club closes you'll either be hearing the ruckus outside the hotel or in the hallway outside your room from those who had one too many drinks. We had to call security on more than one occasion during our stay. I'd suggest bringing heavy duty earplugs if sleep is important to you during your stay. 
That being said we did find the staff very courteous and extremely helpful especially those that worked the concierge desk. We appreciated the use of a nicely equipped gym but the rooftop swimming pool is more of a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""set design piece"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" than a pool you can actually use.
To enjoy your first cup of coffee of the day one needs to make the trek down to the lobby to get it as the rooms are not equipped with coffee machines. We did eventually ask for a coffee maker for the room and they were nice enough to provide one but they had to be reminded daily to provide the coffee for it.
The location of the hotel was convenient for our purposes but the neighbourhood as such left a lot to be desired (unless you're looking for a tattoo parlour that is, there are lots of them in the area).
So would I recommend this hotel? yes and no. It all depends on what you're looking for.

There is a nice and casual restaurant on premise, The Blue Mermaid. For breakfast, check out the dive restaurants right behind the hotel that serve excellent waffles and pancakes (Off North Point).

In ----, we stayed there - times (March & Christmas). In the March visit, we had to move rooms due to outside room noise from neighboring room and loud mechanical elevator noise. We were going to be moved to a room father away from the elevator but I decided to upgrade to a higher floor that includes a breakfast. For asking, I was harassed by the staff member Michael (which the review below my raves about) because he thought I was trying to get the upgrade for free. He also assumed the I was with another family due to my skin color and asked if I can translate what that guess was saying. Long story short for that visit, I paid for the upgrade, complained to the manager on duty and they sent a bunch of cookies with a written apologize from Michael to our room. Cookie = No Problems 
We recently came back from our latest and final stay there. This time we were moved rooms @--pm because our room locked us in and their wasn’t a way out. Mind you the kids are asleep and we had already made ourselves comfortable. I got a call saying that a bell guy was coming up with a key and wondered if we needed help. Really? It almost seemed as though we were an inconvenience to the hotel staff because their room door locked us in. No apology, nothing except the bell guy knocking on the door and handing me a key to the next room. Next morning we wake up and there is no hot water to take showers (Houston temp that morning -- degrees). So instead of calling, I get dressed and head downstairs. - front staff, just waiting and another helping someone and has someone waiting. I go to the guy and tell him my issues from the night before and the no hot water (No apology) and he said that he knew and that some floors were also experiencing the same thing. I told him I wasn’t satisfied with his answer or service and wanted to speak to the manager. He said I needed to wait in line behind the other - guest. When I get in line, the guest waiting also said they had the same issue and she was going to ask for her day to be complimented. Sure enough the manager complied to her wish. When it was my turn, she said she couldn’t do the same thing and could only take care of my parking fee for that day and the room service I order for my son.
Long story short (I have to stop writing as I’m getting upset of the mistreatment my family received), DoubleTree Guest Suites at the Galleria is an older hotel (with a nice front to cover the inside negligence so don’t get fooled) which has big guest rooms and within walking distance to the Galleria. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone anymore, there are other hotels in the area with the same features or better.

We were given certificates to grab a free beer at the restaurant across the street which was great, when we returned at -pm our room was ready, but the staff was very deliberately rude. My friends husband was told when we called the day before that the reservation was set under the name of his wife, and the room was paid for and all we had to do was show up and get the room key. The front desk agent told us the room was not paid for, and that my friend had to have a credit card. She handed him her husbands credit card and his ID, he promptly said he couldn't take it even though that same card had reserved the room. She pulled up her bank and showed that the amount of the room was already pending in their bank account. He immediately began to become agitated and annoyed saying that she had to provide a different card. She obliged and he then said the card was declined. She told him to try again and he refused. I pulled out my card, handed it to him and he again stated it was declined. She and I both pulled up our accounts and showed him that there was no reason for the cards to be declined and for him to try it again. He finally did and her card worked. He gave us the key and walked away. Rude. The sad part is the MOD was standing right there and she didn't even try to step in, just rolled her eyes at us repeatedly.

21278,"The Four Seasons New York is one of those iconic hotels that people will visit regardless of the fluctuations in service and the day to day ups and downs of the travel business and global economic climate. Its public spaces are some of the most timeless and beautiful in the world. I have been staying at this hotel for -- years and it has much nostalgia for me. This is why I am so disappointed with the current state of the hotel. Pretty much my one and only barometer that I use to judge hotels around the world is value for money. Am I getting what I paid for? I am entirely happy to stay in a $---- a night room if I feel it is worth it. By the same token I am happy to say in a $--- a night room as I know what to expect. This brings me to my most recent stay at the Four Seasons in New York. I booked a Park View suite for around $---- a night. Again, New York is expensive and I am happy to pay it if there is value, thats just the reality of the hotel business at the ultra luxe end of the market. Sadly, the FSNY has deeply disappointed me. When you are paying this amount of money per night one would expect the TV's in the room to be replaced more than once every -- years. One would expect a bottle of water at turn down by the bed -- as is the case in nearly every other - star hotel on earth. One would expect to not have to pay an extra $-- per day on internet. One would expect not to have a TV remote control that has the back battery case taped on, and one would expect not to be in a hotel suite that clearly had its heydey in the mid ----'s. Unfortunately all of the above and much more was lacking from my suite at the Four Seasons. It is quite sad for me as this hotel could be among the best in the world and does not need to go down the road of relying on its location and fame to draw customers. At the very top end of the hotel market it is the little things that matter as there is so much fierce competition -- so, yes, hotels are made or broken by things like paying ---- per night and not having water by your bed. It is a very unfortunate turn of events for this iconic property and I hope they are able to reverse this trend rather quickly before people start to realize how much better the value is elsewhere in New York.",1,four season new york one iconic hotel people visit regardless fluctuation service day day ups down travel business global economic climate public space timeless beautiful world stay hotel year much nostalgia disappointed current state hotel pretty much one barometer use judge hotel around world value money get pay entirely happy stay night room feel worth token happy say night room know expect bring recent stay four season new york book park view suite around night new york expensive happy pay value thats reality hotel business ultra luxe end market sadly fsny deeply disappointed pay amount money per night one would expect tv's room replace every year one would expect bottle water turn bed case nearly every star hotel earth one would expect pay extra per day internet one would expect tv remote control back battery case tap one would expect hotel suite clearly heydey mid unfortunately much lack suite four season quite sad hotel could among best world need go road rely location fame draw customer top end hotel market little thing matter much fierce competition yes hotel make broken thing like pay per night water bed unfortunate turn event iconic property hope able reverse trend rather quickly people start realize much good value elsewhere new york,0.6808346,0.0322958,-0.61280406,-0.118179895,1.5903875,-0.48466682,1.5143874,0.29227453
323,"My new husband and I stayed at this hotel -th November for -nights. I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all.

The hotel was completely empty yet they couldn't put our family in adjoining rooms. Understandable our room did not get cleaned for days and the spa was sporatically open because they were short on staff. We understood their predicament that employees were few and far between and were sensitive to it. As soon as the water receded and the marathon was coming they told us they could not extend our rooms. They would however have rooms at double the rate. We wanted to be housed with our children and were willing to pay up for a suite but then we were told it was a three night minimum. We understood their predicament and were patient with them they however were not so understanding of our situation. We had no electricity at home could not find enough gas to safely leave that night and only wanted to extend for the one night. My feeling is in a hospitality business they were purely business.

18558,"My wife and son and I went to DC for a quick four day visit and based upon the star rating of the hotel, its history and previous reviews decided on the Omni. Here is a breakdown of our thoughts and experience while there.
We booked what is referred to as a Deluxe room directly through the main reservation number. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful lobby and very friendly doormen. A quick look at the grounds and pool also proved to confirm the four star rating this hotel has received. Our initial front desk experience was also very pleasant as they gave my seven year old son a goodie bag filled with coloring books and other activities which thrilled him. 
When we entered our room which was at the very end of an incredibly long hallway, we found the room to be okay. The actual room was a decent size but the bathroom was very small. The pedestal sink had four large cracks in it that had been filled, but the cracks had since become discolored and brown. The carpet in the room had a big red stain in one corner which was partially concealed by a chair, and the two queen beds were something one would expect to find in a $-- per night mom and pop motel. They were hard, the sheets were worn and the bedspread looked like it was from the ----s. The hotel advertises that they offer free WiFi which I needed to use to check emails and conduct business when we were in the room. It was impossible to get a signal unless I held my laptop in one hand and stood near the window. Even then, the signal was intermittent at best.
After totally giving up on the wireless, we went out for dinner. Upon returning the lobby was packed with conference attendees which seems to be a very major source of income for this hotel as it has numerous conference facilities. When we finally got to the front desk to ask about the WiFi situation, the woman behind the desk informed me that they did have some signal boosters available but she needed to save them for the conference attendees as they were from all over the world and needed to have access. I informed her that though I was from the U.S., I too needed access. She informed me there was nothing she could do. I finally spoke with a different staff member who did get me a signal booster but even with this the signal was so poor I was never able to connect consistently.
When we called down that evening to ask could they move us to a room closer to the lobby, with the hope that the signal strength might be better, the front desk team was unwilling to comply with our request. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were left on hold for -- minutes before we were told that the manager was very busy attending to the conference attendees and would need to call me back. Of course we never did receive a call that night.
The following morning, after calmly explaining our dismay at spending over $--- for a room and receiving such substandard service we were relocated a room that was much closer to the lobby. The WiFi signal was stronger but still inconsistent so I resorted to using dial-up access for the remainder of the trip.
Throughout the stay almost every request we made seemed to take a backseat to various conference attendee needs. And I must say that if I was ever attending a conference in DC the hotels facilities are excellent and well designed for one. However, for a vacation visit, I would recommend staying at a hotel that is closer and more conducive to vacationers. The Omni is a grand old hotel with a rich history, but not the four star grand old hotel the description would have you believe.",1,"wife son go dc quick four day visit base upon star rating hotel history previous review decide omni breakdown thought experience there.

18867,"I would definately recommend the Paramount Hotel in New York City to any tourist that wants to spend their time seeing the city. This old building has been recently remodeled. I don't think it was a total overhaul, but I didn't expect a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Presidential Suite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for the rates we paid. The basic rooms are small and provide the essentials. HDTV, ipod dock-alarm clock, ironing board-iron, hot-air hair dryer, and a safe for valuables are the high points of the room we stayed in. Though I didn't utilize the following services, they also offer a fitness center, business center, bar-nightclub, etc. I find it difficult to complain about the size of the room, because we didn't spend much time inside. We were there to see NYC.
 One of the great benefits(for tourists) of the Paramount Hotel in New York is how close it is to Times Square. It's literally only a few hundred feet from the center of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Bowtie"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Times Square is surrounded by many other great """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""districts"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", most of them are only a block or two apart, so it's a great place for tourists on foot. 
 In the opposite direction of times square, and about the same distance, is the center terminal for the Gray Line""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hop-on-hop-off"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" double-decker tour-busses. These are another great asset to the tourist, as they will move you either uptown or downtown and allow you to see the whole city comfortably.
The real beauty of the Paramount is the staff, especially Brian, the Doorman.(New York's Friendly Doorman) While he was busy hailing cabs, loading luggage, etc, I briefly asked him about our ride to the airport. He clearly and effectively answered my question. The next day, without being prompted, he remebered me and which service I was using, and reminded me of that services policies, and also kept me updated as we waited! Though he was very busy, he was still very personable. I don't have a particularly memorable face, so the fact that he recalled all of the info from our initial conversation tells me he's a man who takes his job seriously and performs it very well.
We had one small issue with the TV in our room, and it was remedied immediately. All of the staff we encountered were great. Everyone seemed happy, and greeted us warmly.

21421,"We spent three nights at this hotel and we were very pleased with it. Its location close to the airport made an early morning departure very easy. The shuttle zipped us right from the front door to the airport, no problems. We had a two bedroom suite: parents in one room, kids in the other. It was roomy enough for us to have one child in the pull-out sofa bed and another in a roll away bed. The main bed was very comfortable and the rooms were all spacious. We also had a microwave, small refrigerator, and another small sink. It was great to have these in our room, especially the fridge. A great breakfast was provided each morning with lots of hot and cold choices to meet everyone's needs. We enjoyed the manager's reception each night, too. It was great to come in from a long day of sightseeing to snacks and drinks right there in the lobby. 
The hotel is in the vicinity of a T station. It's a five-ish minute walk across the park to get there. The park that's adjacent to the hotel has lots of playground equipment and a splash area. Great for kids who need to burn some energy.
There is an indoor pool, which I did think was a little bit small for a hotel of this size. It was pretty crowded when we were there. My kids didn't mind because they had lots of other kids to play with. We used the business center to check in and print our boarding passes, which was another great convenience. Overall, the entire hotel was clean. It seemed like some parts of the facility were maybe a little bit older, but I also noticed that certain fixtures had been replaced and updated. There wasn't anything that stood out to me as extremely old. Our room itself was clean and the furniture and fixtures were up to date.
My one complaint is that we really had to turn our air conditioner down to cool the room. It was hot while we were there (--'s) and we were on the -th floor, so I don't know if that was it or if the unit wasn't quite working right.

2323,"I read the reviews and was a little hesitant, but considering the cost of this hotel is less than $---night compared to other hotels in San Fran in the $---+ range, this wasn't that bad! Last year I stayed at the Hotel Serrano, where I paid $----night and was told by the bellman, this isn't a bad neighborhood, as long as you don't go """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""that way..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as he pointed over his shoulder. I eventually ended up checking out of the Serrano and moving to the Hyatt, and wasn't as lucky through travelocity at getting reimbursed for paying for a room I didn't stay in! At the Broadway I wasn't concerned one bit which way I walked. It was a very nice neighborhood, but busy with traffic due to Van Ness being a major street.
The front desk personnel were very nice. The location is convenient, within walking distance to the wharf, chinatown, the cable cars, lombard street, etc. Some of the hills can be a challenge though depending upon which way you go. The free parking is an awesome deal, considering most places charge about $-- - $-- for parking. The parking area was kind of tight, and I felt my vehicle was safe.
The room smelled a little musty like the carpet had been cleaned, but the beds were better than some of the places where I paid $----night. No air, but it really wasn't needed this time of year, the fridge, coffee maker, microwave, tv all worked fine. The noise wasn't THAT bad either. Except for the people that stayed above us and had to stomp their feet as they walked! People-wake up and realize - there are people above and below you - just be a little considerate of others and half the noise problems wouldn't exist. Even the attached coffee shop was nice, and the service quick and food very good.
Overall when you compare the less than $---rate against the $----night rate, it's a very good deal if you want the convenience of staying in the city and avoid driving. But if you want glitz and glamour, and want to pay for it, stay at one of the wharf hotels where you'll pay more than double, for just another place to sleep!
I'd go back again as long as the price stays in this range. If it gets much higher than this, and I still want to save money, I'd stay at one of the cheaper hotels near the airport or even in Oakland and drive into the city and park each day, then just ride the cable car or muni around.

14918,"New York is my favourite city in the world and the LES is my favourite neighbourhood so I was hugely excitied when I found out that a new luxury hotel had opened there and immediately rushed to book. I was aware that the hotel was fairly newly opened so expected that there may be some issues. Unfortunately some of the disappointment I experienced was nothing to do with newness - rather there is just a really bad finish to some of the fittings. Given the supposed standard of this hotel I would have expected better. First class hotels need a first class finish - that is what customers are paying for. I have a horrible feeling that the rivington hopes to attract the kind of guests to whom shelling out big money is nothing. I'm not one of these guests - this was a big treat for me and was supposed to be my first experience of a really good new york hotel. I was particulary shocked by the lack of music in the rooms - having to pay for the privelege when the rooms are so expensive seems really mean. On check out we were informed that we could have had an i-pod docking station, however this was not mentioned when we checked in and was no-where in the hotel literature. Also - even if we had been mad enough to pay for music in our rooms - the selection was dismal. Not what one would expect from a hotel situated right in the heart of New York's hippest music area and presumably targetting the kind of audience who want to hang out in local bars, clubs and gig venues. 
My biggest disappointment was the view (or lack of) I was of the impression that even the cheaper rooms had great views of the skyline - wrong!! all I could see was the restaurant and the fairly grimy back yard.
On the plus side - and yes there were some - the basic design of the hotel is good and the staff were very friendly. The bed was AMAZING - don't think I have ever slept so well, and the mid level bar was really nice and cosy. However I can't shake off the feeling that the price is just to high for what is on offer, and I know that when I was there I was still getting quite a good deal as not everything was complete. The rates have gone up substantially in the last year. If I could afford it I would perhaps still book a room, but only because of where it is.

I booked a room at the Hotel Andra almost - months before we went to Seattle. I booked directly through their website for a room described as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""- Queens or - King"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I made a note in the reservation that I wanted the - King, as I was going with my boyfriend. When I got my confirmation via email, it said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""- Queens"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but the note was on there about the - King, so I didn't worry about it. 
When we arrived, I verified with the front desk agent that we were indeed getting - King, not - Queens. He said only the - Queens room was available. Obviously, we did not want to spend our vacation time sleeping in separate beds. The only thing available with - bed was a Queen. In other words, we were downgraded. There was no offer made to lower our rate, though. I blew it off at first because we had received a great rate anyway. After we spent one night in the room, we were both miserable and grumpy with each other. The queen bed was just way too tiny after being used to a King at home, and the room itself was also incredibly small. The bathroom was hardly big enough to turn around in. 
And our view? Construction and another apartment building. I complained to a manager, who said they were completely booked so there was nothing he could do. We went back to our room, looked online, and were able to book a much nicer room beginning the next day (we were in town for - nights). I told the manager I was going to check out the next day. He told me I'd have to pay a $-- cancellation fee! When I balked, he said he'd have to talk to the reservation manager to get that waived, and he'd call me in the morning. We checked out and I told the woman at the front desk that I did not want to be charged the fee. She said ok, and didn't charge me. So, this was the only positive part of the experience. The reservation manager never called me. 
Aside from all this, I still wouldn't have liked this place- the neighborhood is really sketchy, even though there's a bunch of nice restaurants. We got asked for money every time we walked out of the hotel.

The hotel has a nice --s art-deco theme throughout. The restaurant is overpriced and it is better to eat from outside the hotel, as it is better value for money. The free daily breakfast is nice, and a good mix of cakes, breads, fruit, cereals and drinks are available.

21027,"I have stayed at W Seattle three times now (once each in ----, ---- & ----). And each time, my opinion of this property has dropped several notches. During my first stay, I found the hotel to be a warm, cozy respite from the hectic world outside. I was impressed by the trendy decor and friendly staff. The second time, I felt the same about the hotel, except that I had noticed that the staff was colder and didn't exude much of a welcoming attitude(especially one of the rude concierge team members). This most recent time (July ---, ----), I realized that I am officially over this W location. The employees were very aloof for the most part - and the ones who weren't aloof, just weren't very friendly and warm. There was the lovely housekeeper on our floor who was cheery and happy. And there were also the semi-friendly bartenders, although one was telling us about how unsafe the parking garage is at this hotel and how many break-ins have taken place (!!) And don't get me started on the sleazy-looking concierge staff! The hotel is also looking a little worn-around-the-edges and definitely needs a little sprucing up. And the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hip"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" factor that the W Brand has tried so hard to establish is gone. Now it seems as though the hotel is appealing to a more low-rent crowd (there were the young couple who were being sexually active in the hallway as the elevator door opened and the guy came in with me, while zipping up his pants). I'm just over it. For my next visit to Seattle, I will definitely try one of the newer boutique hotels or the Doubletree Arctic Club. 
W Seattle is still a clean, comfortable hotel. I have never had an awful experience here. But it has just lost a lot of it's unique appeal - partly attributed to the unfriendly, unmotivated employees and the lack of a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""WOW"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" factor. I would stay again, but would choose several other hotels first before making a reservation here again.",1,"stay seattle three time time opinion property drop several notch first stay find hotel warm cozy respite hectic world outside impressed trendy decor friendly staff second time felt hotel except noticed staff colder exude much welcoming attitude(especially one rude concierge team member recent time july realize officially location employee aloof part one aloof friendly warm lovely housekeeper floor cheery happy also semi-friendly bartender although one tell unsafe park garage hotel many break-in take place get start sleazy-looking concierge staff hotel also look little worn-around-the-edges definitely need little spruce hip factor brand try hard establish go seem though hotel appeal low-rent crowd young couple sexually active hallway elevator door open guy come zip pant i'm next visit seattle definitely try one new boutique hotel doubletree arctic club

The staff does a great job, in a modern and unobtrusive way. Small touches like a doorman who introduces himself properly made me feel right at home. So, are there no downsides? Well … perfection comes at a price so I won't complain there. But something that could easily be improved is the noise in the hallway.

Suite was perfect for us, a living room with pullout sofa, nice little kitchenette with refridge-micro-sink and then a separate bedroom.

We found the staff approachable and helpful but never obsequious or pushy. I hate having my bed turned down (what’s the point?) or having my bags carried for me unnecessarily. Maybe this less intrusive style of service suits European visitors more than those from the US.
The greatest burger joint – the contrast of the steamy, groovy café was such a contrast to the slick lobby area, it was as if we were walking through the wardrobe into Narnia! It’s so hidden, we’d never have found it without being told where it was. Can’t wait to go back.

Check in was smooth, cookies given and despite being a loyal and recurrent Hilton Honours user no upgrade given or any other benefit. 
Room was beautifully styled but very small as many reviewers have already stated. Smallest i've ever had in NYC. Suitcases ended up piled up on top of one another on top of the wardrobe. 
The location is fantastic on the west side where we normally would stay and we have stayed in Chelsea previously so were familiar with the area. It is handy for everything. At either end of the street there are coffee shops for breakfast if you don't have hotel breakfast as part of your deal. 
Business Centre and Gym on basement floor. Both free for guests and great! 
Beds are so comfortable and we had great, sound sleeps. Room service were excellent and the rooms cleaned to perfection everyday although dirty towels got taken away but not replaced on two occasions and we had to call down to get them. That reminds me, there is a care line to call to sort out any problems or seek guidance on hotel related issues. I contacted the line relating to having laundry done. This is a wonderful service to have in any hotel as who wants clothes that you've been travelling in lying around. Rather than leave it in your room and have it collected and returned by room service like in every other hotel I've ever encountered. In this hotel, you have to take it down to reception and even once it is returned to the hotel you have to go and collect it. Luckily on my last night I remembered I had put laundry in - as it hadn't been returned to our room as I expected - so I had to go and collect it myself. I really would have expected laundry returns to have been brought up to guests rooms like in every other hotel or am I being petty? 
Cheltons' bar & grill is great for dinner and we ate there on our last night. Fantastic chef there on the night we ate. Great dinner had by both of us. Cheltons itself is lacking ambience & someone needs to go up to Hilton on Lexington to get some interior design ideas to template into Cheltons to bring the level of interior presentation up. 
We were introduced to Watermelon Martinis by Erica the utterly fantastic bartender, and replicated on another day by Sean. After having them on our -nd night we featured a visit to Erica @ Cheltons and her Mixology into every night of our stay! Her lemon drop martinis were utterly gorgeous too! A friend was visiting us and we ordered her one as well which came out in a non - martini glass as the hotel only seems to have two of these glasses!! 
The strength of the staff at Doubletree Hilton @ Chelsea turned around our stay there! Where as my original idea would be that I'd never stay there again, the levels of service and outright friendliness lift this hotel from the doldrums! Special thanks to Erica, Izzy, Omar, Sean plus the guy who recommended """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Cafeteria"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as well!

Located in the most central and convienant of locations in the city is a small boutique hotel, The Roger Smith Hotel, staffed by the most amazing, caring and wonderful people in New York City. Not only have they embraced me, but now, my entire family (we have all stayed at various times and our visits are many, now) and the first few of many dear friends that I will personally recommend to this gem. I know I am not alone in my praise, for often in the elevator, or the lobby other guests have remarked at how wonderful the staff has made them feel. Each room and suite has a character of its own and while not all are absolutely perfect, any flaws are more than made up by the friendliness and competance of the excellent staff and the convenience of the location. If you want to feel part of a family, special and welcomed by the best New York has to offer you will hurry to make a reservation at this truly remarkable hotel. My many thanks: Kucuk, Randy, Mani, Sophy, Gemma, Rafael, Deforest, Vicenc, a wonderful house keeping staff and, please, forgive me, to those few I haven't mentioned by name, you are equally wonderful.

Location is fantastic – it’s in a leafy street in pretty Murray Hill and we were easily able to walk to most places (MSG, Empire State, Times Square etc).
Hotel itself is old and the rooms reflect that unfortunately. Room had a great view of the Chrysler building but could have done with more lighting and the air con was very noisy. 
One of the elevators was broken which meant having to wait for the one working elevator and when it did arrive it always seemed to be packed with service staff and their equipment. This started to annoy us by the end of our trip.
We asked about the Acura car service but were told that contract had finished the week before our stay and so it was no longer available. It was a shame as that had been a selling point and we were counting on using it but not to worry, metro stations and cabs cheap and a plenty around the hotel.
One note – on our last night we had a letter slipped under our door during the night letting us know the hotel had changed owners and was no longer a W Hotel but rather now a ‘St Giles’ which i believe is a British chain- not sure how this will change the hotel.

In fact, the noise the one night we stayed didn't bother us. My wife is a light sleeper and wasn't woken up once by jet noise, but perhaps we were just lucky.

I won't go into details about the close proximity to all the attractions as this has been mentioned in plenty of other reviews. I give it five stars because I think the quality and size of the suites provided excellent value for money. Having a separate living area and bedroom meant we had ample room for all our luggage, shopping etc, and it was nice to have a sofa area to relax in. Both rooms had big LCD TVs with plenty of channels. We enjoyed having the local news on in the background and watching shows like Good Morning America which was being filmed live just a short walk away. The decor was modern and the rooms were very neat and well-kept. The bathroom was of a sufficient size and standard.
We only went for breakfast at Ginger's in the hotel once as we wanted to try different places in the city but the buffet was of an impressive size and high quality. The cookie they give you at the welcome desk on check-in is a welcome touch and the hotel was decorated in tasteful yet fun fashion for the festive season.
Service was absolutely fine, nothing special. The only bad point was the horrible, surly man when we left our bags after we checked out as we had a late flight. Miserable, rude and abrupt with us, was really disappointing for me on our last day. Not going to upset my overall review though, I must say. 
No, it doesn't provide opulent levels of luxury - however, it does provide high quality, sophisticated accommodations in an unbeatable city-centre location for what I think is an incredibly reasonable price. I would thoroughly recommend.

We, like most people, look at reviews when choosing a hotel and often wonder if what we are reading gives a totally true picture, but having stayed at this hotel we can now readily endorse everything that people have said.
The hotel is in a great location on E--St., equi-distant between Fifth Avenue and Madison, so if you want a cab to go up town it's just a moments walk to the corner of E--St & Madison, and returning, the cab can drop you on the corner of E--St & Fifth which again is just a few moments walk from the hotel. Perfect! 
If you want to walk rather than take a cab then again the hotel is within easy walking distance of many attractions.
Our room was smallish, (not unusual in NYC), but had all that we needed, quietness, (apart from a nosiy air-conditioning unit), a very comfortable bed, and was nicely furnished. We've stayed in NYC on many occasions and this was certainly one of the quietess rooms we've stayed in. The room was situated on the -th floor in the middle of the hotel so there was no view but our priority was a quiet room and that's what we got.
Important point: there is some extension work being carried out next door so there is a possibility that some rooms could be affected by noise - best ask when booking-checking in.
The staff at the front desk and the bell boys were all very friendly and helpful, which is important in any hotel and made our stay more enjoyable - nothing was too much trouble for them.
The hotel had some nice little touches such as internet access in the lobby so we were able to check-in online and print our boarding passes for our flight home. There is also free tea-coffee and iced water available ---- in the lobby.
One slight negative, but of no real importance to us, is that we found the small cocktail bar dark and univiting.

The staff were pleasant and the location is central to every attraction that you would like to visit. Arch Street itself though is a bit rough to be polite. I was on the -th floor but could still here noisy passers by each night. My room was a good size with a king size bed, fridge and microwave for $--- per night. The bathroom basin was my main issue. The stopper was broken so you have to lift it a few millimetres to let the water out. Quite annoying, but worse was to come. After brushing my teeth I decided to lift the stopper out about an inch so that the water could run out freely. I made the mistake of looking under the stopper. The grime. Ugh. The sight stuck with me the next day and I strolled the surrounding streets Market, Chestnut and Walnut only to find that there were quite a few hotels in the same area. On the map that I had looked at before leaving London they looked much further apart. I checked into the Loews on Market St for two nights and liked it so much that I extended and stayed for seven nights in total. It is less than - mins walk from the Hilton. The Marriott is across the road. All in all the Hilton was adequate for a three star hotel, but not the sort of place for an extended stay. One or two nights would be fine, but if you are not on a budget I would opt for somewhere else. Oh, one good thing about the Hilton was that you could use the business centre i.e use one of three laptops and access the internet without paying any further fees. The Loews charges $-- for -- mins.

In any case, the booking online was excellent. I also received several follow up emails right up to the time of travelling including an email asking for any special preferences I had before arriving. I was also able to book a great hotel pick up when i called the front desk. Since I was travelling with another family member, I did not realise that on line i choose the junior suite which was just one room and study. When we checked in the front desk staff were very thought ful enough to suggest that we may be more comfortable upgrading to a large suite which had a separate bed room and living room. I must say that was such an excellent touch as that meant we were much more comfortable especially as I would be recovering from some treatment.
The staff at the hotel were excellent and very friendly pointing out all the near by places. Also a very nice touch is that in the rooms they have a lovely guide which tells you all the nearby by chemists, shops by category and places to eat.
The hotel is an excellent place to stay if you plan to have any medical treatment and want a quiet place to recover. The best part is how everything is so close. There were lots of food options around. A very handy chemist close by which i needed. Also they had a lovely Chinese close by. It was also very convenient in the sense that it was very central especially being close to all the nearby hospitals. Also the kitchen was a good size with a dishwasher, big fridge etc. 
We spent a total of - weeks there and overall it was an amazing place to just relax and recover. The beds were very comfortable and the nice touch of being able to order unlimited extra pillows of different types was great. They also had a convenient laundrette you could use.

As we went to our room, I noticed a room service tray on the floor a few doors down from our room. I thinking, oh, hasn't been picked up yet, no big deal. No complaints about our room and we were excited to see a small refrigerator available for our use. The bathroom was a great size. However there were no handtowels and the bathtub didn't drain well, filling up with water when we showered. Friday morning I informed the front desk of the drainage problem and it was taken care of right away. Because the bathtub problem was resolved so quicky, I was surprised that the room service tray from Thursday night was still in the hall. We left the hotel about -, returning at -, Friday afternoon and the tray was still there. Saturday morning around -, I told the front desk about the tray. It is hard to believe that housekeeping hadn't picked it up yet. We stopped by the hotel about - and the tray was still there! At this point, I am making a mission out of getting the tray removed. Who wants to look at dirty dishes as they walk to their room? I called Service Express and told them about the tray.

At this point, I took the tray with its dirty dishes and half full pitcher of tea, down -- floors to the front desk. I don't know what the issue is with housekeeping. There must be some kind of problem if a tray is left in a hallway from Thursday to Saturday night. Who knows how long it had been there before we checked in?

12250,"The title says it all. Last time I stayed at this hotel was a personal trip two years back; I had a room over some kind of loading dock or something that kept me up most of the night. This time I stayed for business, with no better luck. The hotel itself is fairly grand -- it's actually enormous -- but if you want to see it I recommend going for a day visit rather than staying.
The room was spacious enough (see photo), but the bed was horribly uncomfortable. It was exceedingly firm, and the rough sheets and linen felt well below Marriott standards. Indeed, it seemed like they were using a mattress pad as a blanket. To make things worse, there was an ice machine directly across the hall from my room that every few minutes made lots of noise. There was no door into the ice room, so the noise and light came unimpeded directly into my room. Piling pillows against the door kept out some light but not the noise (see photo). (Hey, when you're trying to sleep you'll do whatever you can think of that doesn't involve packing up and moving to another room at - a.m.!) When I turned on the shower, the drain didn't work properly, so the tub quickly filled with over an -"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of standing water that didn't go down until after I left. There's free internet access in the lobby to print out boarding passes, but the connection was horrendously slow, so don't bet on it working (at least, not quickly). There's a small grocery-type store in the lobby, but there's also a dozen or more restaurants on Connecticut avenue at the foot of the hotel, and several of them are quite good. 
Suffice to say, I did not get a good night's sleep, and ultimately, that's what a hotel is for, so I had to lower the ratings.

5809,"We usually seek out Embassy Suites when traveling with the kids because the room layouts are great for us. This ES was not disappointing in that regard. The room was a nice size with a good size bathroom and a convenient extra sink in the bedroom. The linens on the bed were very nice and comfortable. I found the bathroom to be a little run down looking. Also, the suite was dusty. It seemed that housekeeping did the bare minimum, so if there was dust, it made you wonder what other cleaning shortcuts were taken with disinfecting, etc.
The free breakfast is honestly not worth the aggrevation. The food is almost not edible and it is so crowded that breakfast leaves you feeling stressed instead of relaxed.

We even walked from Nationals Park after the baseball games, and it is only about an hour walk to the hotel. 
The hotel is also very secure. At night they have staff waiting at the entrances, and you have to show your room card in order to get into the hotel. This should help to give guests piece of mind.

18326,"I stayed at the Comfort Inn Manhattan Bridge for one night in September ----. I had a late check-in and a very early morning check-out and both went smoothly with reception staff, who were kind and courteous.
The hotel's well located, in that it's in the centre of Chinatown, so if you like hustle and bustle, it's great. Downside is that when trading hours are over, the area is quite desolate and empty, so you may find yourself alone on the street at night: not great if you're a woman travelling alone, like me. Saying that, it's right next to Soho and the LES, which you can reach by walking, or a short hop in a cab; you're near to all the restaurants and nightlife you could wish for.
The double-aspect room I stayed in - on the fifth floor - was smart, very clean, and nicely presented. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, and the (free) WiFi worked smoothly and at high-speed. I also had a view of the Manhattan Bridge (which the hotel is practically adjacent to), which was lovely.

37900,"I am writing this review a bit earlier than expected. 
You see I was woken up at -:--AM by a brand new flat panel TV in the breakfast area blasting the news to all those suckers who happen to be sleeping on the sofa bed in the front room of the - room suite. If you have never stayed at an embassy suites they have an atrium that all rooms face so it's either really cool or really annoying depending on whether you are deaf or not.
When I could no longer take the before dawn intrusion I did what most reasonable people would do, called the front desk. What I got is 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I will call and ask them to turn it down""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
funny cause the lobby is what ,-- feet from the blaring TV. So I laid back down waiting for the peace and quite I expect at - in the morning. Gues what? someone turned it up. I must have cheesed them off by politely asking them to do, I don't know, their job maybe. I should be ashamed of myself for bothering them and just shut my yap, but funny thing is, I then got a bit mad. I called down again.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I can still hear it""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sir I asked them to turn it down"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK then why does it seem to be louder?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""(sigh) I will call them again"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
Click. She hung up on me. I must have bothered her again I guess. So again I tucked myself under the cheesy velor blanket trying to recapture my dream.
-- minutes pass. No change in the volume. I heard every news story, every commercial, every Olympic fanfare (It was NBC).
That was IT. I called again """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I will get dressed and go down there and turn it down myself"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Silence (from the front desk I could almost hear her thinking """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""whatever"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ) Click she hung up on me again.
So I get dressed and go on down (hey I was up on the -th floor) and walked up to the offending TV. Not a single guest watching it. Just blasting to no one in particular. I see a staff member walking by and I ask """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""can you help me turn this down"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and she barks at me """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we don't have the remote, we don't know how to do it"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and she walks away. 
What have I done to deserve this? I checked my breath and my zipper, my nose and my BO and I honestly don't know why I was getting them so upset. I was really really bothering them maybe I should just shut up go back to my room and pay my bill and leave them alone, you know give myself a time out. But hey, I am an adult, I have atayed at maybe -- different ES and booked trade shows and meeting for a living so I am used to dealing with hotels. The good ones trya nd make their guest feel special, the bad ones, well read on.
So, last chance, I walk up to the front desk """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hi, I am the guy who called about the TV and the folks in the breakfast area says that they don't have the remote""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK sir I just got here what is the problem"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so I repeat my sad tale and she say's to me """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""what floor are you on?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the -th. She rolls her eyes in disbelief that I could hear it way up there. So she say's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""let me ask Ellen she took your call"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so she steps back and I hear some mumbling and she walsk back and says """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sir Ellen turned it down herself she has the remote"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK its still blasting, it's not down enough"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" . """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Yes it is, sir it's our ploicy to turn the TV's on at -AM and we can't do anything about it"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
Now i am normaly a tolerant fellow who expects a bit of noise from other guest rooms (kids Tv's or just chatter from folks walking down the hall) but I surely did not exext to get """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""attitude"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from the front desk for just asking them to turn down the volume.
So I say to her """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""It's -:--, and I'ts been on for a while"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sir that's our policy, how long will you be with us"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""One more night"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sorry we can't help you""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I was flabbergassed. Why in the world would I make this stuff up. Do they seriously think I sit there at - AM waiting to complain about something. That I am making it all up or just over sensitive?
Yes they do, yes they do because what happened next summed up the whole bitter exchange. I said to her """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I hope someone would please go over and listen to the volume"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Ellen never showed her face and her flunky just looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. So I grabed one of those """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tell us how we are doing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cards and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Someone is going to hear about this"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and as I walked away I heard her say under her breath
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stupid""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I turned around and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""what di you say"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and she say's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I said It's early""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
[--] lady. I heard it correctly the first time. Remember I am the guy that can hear a TV from seven stories up.
She never checked it out, never smiled or acknowleged my concern and gte theis, as i walked away she called me STUPID.
Thanks Ellen, Thanks rude employee who barked at me in the lounge """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we don't know how to do it"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and a big thank you to the front desk clerk who rolled her eyes ignored my reasonable request and called me stupid. Fianlly a big thank you to Embassy Suites La Jolla. I will never forget you. You know just how to treat your guest, 
Like [--].
Wow,and it only took me ---.-- to figure it out.

Last time we went to NYC we stayed in New Jersey to save money and took a train in to the city every day. Big mistake.

They provided us with some touristy handouts and a map which came in handy later. We were on the --th floor - I think there are -- or so in the building. The room and bed were pretty small - but that goes with the territory for NYC. The bathroom was ridiculously small as you can see from the picture I posted. Looking out the window you could see the Empire State Building towering overhead, lit beautifully in the night. We usually leave our DO NOT DISTURB sign out all the time. Housekeeping gave us a courtesy call (left a message) letting us know that if we wanted our room cleaned we could call them by -pm. I thought that was considerate. 
I would definitely stay here again, even though the bathroom was SO small. The location is absolutely wonderful.

26495,"My great experience at this hotel began with a glass of wine during check-in and ended with a gracious extension of check-out time on the last day of the trip. I was in Jacksonville for a convention at the Hyatt, but the pricey rooms (even at convention rate) did not fit my budget. After reviewing several on Trip Advisor, I settled on the Hamption Inn Jacksonville - I--- Central. 
While not in a particularly lively section of Jacksonville, the hotel is conveniently located about a block away from the JTA Skyway, which provided an inexpensive way ($-.-- per ride) to get to and from the Hyatt (alleviating the need to pay $---day parking at the Hyatt) and points on the other side of the river. Unfortunately, the Skyway doesn't extend beyond downtown Jacksonville, so you will still need a way to get to points beyond downtown, particularly because there are few, if any, inexpensive restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. If you are looking for upscale dining, there is a lovely restaurant right across the street and another down the block. Otherwise, you are limited to the few fast food restaurants located in the Jacksonville Landing (across the river). That being said, the hotel staff were more than willing to assist me in finding restaurants that would deliver.
Aside from the convenient location, the service at this hotel is outstanding. All of the staff members that I encountered were friendly and extremely helpful. All of the desk clerks greeted me by name when I returned to the hotel each evening. The nightly reception (consisting of white or red wine, two types of beer and various snacks) was a wonderful way to wind down after a long day in educational sessions. The morning breakfast provided just enough hot and cold selections to keep me satisfied until lunch time and for the mornings when I didn't have time to actually sit and eat, there were breakfast bags available so I could eat on the go.
I would not recommend this hotel for a vacation, but for a business or other quick trip to Jacksonville, it was an economical choice and I would most definitely stay here again.",0,"great experience hotel begin glass wine check-in end gracious extension check-out time last day trip jacksonville convention hyatt pricey room even convention rate fit budget review several trip advisor settle hamption inn jacksonville central

I can easily overlook a few dings on the baseboards and doors in exchange for charm.

Again, the public areas such as the lobby and seating areas were lovely, but overall the hotel felt very chilly and, well...business-like.

21557,"We just returned from a --night, weekend stay at the Marriott Financial Center. Overall, we had a good experience with our family of four, which includes two small boys ages - & -.
We booked directly through Marriott’s reservation service (we participate in the Marriott Rewards program) and requested an upper floor room with a view of the Statue of Liberty and an early check-in. Our check-in around noon on a Thursday was extremely quick and our requests were accommodated. 
The room was clean and a decent size for NYC with an in-room safe, mini-bar, hair dryer, clothes iron & board, small desk, and comfy chair with ottoman. There is a charge for Internet access. The two beds in the room were double not queen size, so they were cramped to share with another. However, the beds themselves, pillows and linens were very comfortable. The bathroom lighting was TERRIBLE! but toiletries and plenty of towels were provided. We had no problems with the elevators or noise from the outside construction.
Housekeeping and room service were pleasant and very responsive to our requests. However, the concierge left a little to be desired. Responses to our inquires were vague at best. They did not seem enthusiastic to help us make our sons’ first trip to NYC and our oldest son’s birthday (being celebrated during our stay and the reason for our trip) a memorable experience.
Our Sunday morning check-out did not go as smoothly as our check-in. The valet was prompt in retrieving our car from the garage. However, after a ----- minute wait for the bell hop to pick up our luggage from our room, we decided to make a couple of trips down to the lobby with the luggage ourselves.
We must agree that the location of the Marriot Financial Center is not the best for tourists, but since it caters to business travelers, weekend rates can be very reasonable.

Once inside you could sense the history that this hotel has, the pictures around the hotel lobby and hallways show how many big stars have stayed here over the years, 
Walking along the spotlessly clean hallway to our room gave us a sense our stay was going to be a good one.
We opened up the door to our room, It was lovely, again spotlessly clean. 
A huge bed dominated the room and with its soft bed linen it made you want to climb right in. 
The decoration was soft colours, Stylish and classy, The bathroom was small, but we were given the option of a large or small bathroom.
 We chose the small bathroom as this room came with a view looking onto the Avenue Of Americas. 
The Hotel is in a great location, close to the subway station, -- minutes walk from Central Park and Times Square. 
There are bars and delis a plenty nearby, for the serious shoppers you have -th Avenue just around the corner with every top designer store your heart desires. It is all literally on your doorstep

If you want your Lady to feel special take her to patsys. The food and service is excellent. It`s where all the stars like Sinatra,Martin,Davis all ate when in New York, 
The pictures of stars past and present litter the walls. a must for my Lady who adores Sinatra,

27524,"Arriving well before check-in time and before the person who had booked the room, I was made to wait in case I was a stalker. They said they needed to protect the person who had booked the room, and that I was not listed on the reservation. Strange, I produced an ID with a name matching the one of the booking, and I also gave them a credit card and said that I would take care of the room. (I had neglected to bring the print-out listing me as the other occupant on the room.)
Thus my stay began in a negative light. Then I was told that there were only two rooms and they gave us the better one. On the third floor. We were facing a miniature courtyard looking into people's kitchen windows. There was absolutely no view. One of the reasons I chose the hotel was because of the raves on TripAdvisor about the views of the Empire State Building. Worse, the toilet was making constant loud dripping sounds until I called for help and they sent an engineer to fix it. There was grout on the tub floor, which they had not smoothed down. It stuck up at sharp points and nearly cut my feet. The bed's nightstands were dirty and not cleaned the entire time we were there. Everything was sticky and the room was very dark.
That being said, the rest of the service staff was nice. The Audrey Cafe staff was sweet.

It is in a terrific location for taking the subway or grabbing cabs on Park or Lex.
I asked three times if we could change rooms and they continually told me that the hotel was fully booked for the next day. As we were staying three days I asked if we could change later in our stay. Again, I was told to ask again. I said, I can wait for the room today and just drop my bags and return after the current guests check out. That appeared to be an impossibility.

26743,"My wife and I spend this weekend in NYC at """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The W"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and it was simply outstanding.
Basics: the room was huge by NYC standards, and absolutely perfect -- stylish, comfortable, unique and has everything. Walls are soundproofed and windows keep out enough of the road noise. I have stayed at several NYC boutique hotels of lesser caliber -- while they had cool lobbies and nice locations they had tiny, not-so-great rooms. W added the minor detail of a fantastic room and exceptional bed. And also had a cool lobby and great location.
Then again, it's far from inexpensive. But sometimes I feel like you pay a lot of money and get a lousy room -- here you spend more and get a LOT more. And, never underestimate the value of a great, great bed :-)
Location is great. Union Square is on the East side at around --th St, which is a very hip and fun place to be -- Times Square is also nice (we stayed around there on several previous visits) but I feel like Union Square is more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""real NYC"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The place was buzzing, and there's great shopping, eating and drinking establishments all nearby. We did shopping """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sorties"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" -- going to one or two stores, carrying back our purchases, resting, and then out for another round. 
The hotel has a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bar off the lobby with great people-watching. Warning: check the bar menu prices before you order drinks (one Margarita: $--. Yeah it was a good drink, but... $--!!!). Another negative: while they have a great restaurant (""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Olives""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""), they stop serving food by --:--, so don't plan on being hungry. Bar service was not great; we had to ask twice to get our check for our pricey drinks; that was a bit of a negative in our overall experience. There are several other good later-night restaurant-bars around which are better bets.
We had lunch at the restaurant -- actually it was brunch. We were not interested in breakfast food, and reluctantly chose from a small number of lunch options ... and were thrilled with the exceptional food. (Disclaimer: we went to the original Olives in Boston shortly after it opened, and have been fans of Todd English's food ever since).
We went to dinner and a show on Saturday night -- the cab drive to the theater district was quick and only a few dollars.
We drove down (from Boston) and left the car in the hands of the valets. Covered, garage parking was quite reasonable, by NY standards.
Bottom line: if you are willing to shell out the money, this hotel is an absolutely great place to stay for a New York weekend.",0,"wife spend weekend nyc simply outstanding.

First, let me say that the lobby and ballrooms are lovely and evocative of Versailles. Do not leave the lobby as it truly goes downhill from there.
The hotel was overbooked and gave our group smoking rooms. I don't smoke, but am not an obsessive anti-smoker and usually have no problem in this situation. THESE ROOMS WERE VILE! The smoke smell was unbelievably oppressive. No one had attempted to air it, Febreze it or even spray a bit of Glade. For the days I was there, I avoided my room until absolutely ready to sleep, as did my travel mates.
Check out was at --AM, and we were giving a presentation from -----:-- and asked for a noon check-out. They would not accommodate us, so we had to drag our luggage down to the bellman and after we presented, we lugged it down (stairs) into the changing rooms in the basement-level fitness center. I travel a great deal and rarely request late check-out, but have not had such a direct refusal.
Beware of extra charges. The hotel imposes service fees for your stay on top of the room fee and taxes. Also, in the coffee shop, I was overcharged. I asked for cappuccino, but the machine was broken. That did not stop the young women for charging me cappuccino price for a regular coffee. 
As others have mentioned, if you do not valet park, you will be traveling a considerable distance through many heavy doors.

If your wanting to hang in the West End area this hotel is the perfect location. The West End bars & restaurants are literally right behind this hotel. You can bar hop and walk home to the hotel. very easy.
However, the afternoon-evening staff when we check in Sat. about -:--pm was very rude. The valet staff was lazy and rude. I walked in to give him my keys and he couldn't even bother to stand up.

34341,"This hotel could be amazing, but it is just short of that. Had it been on a less hotel-populated road, I might have given this hotel a better review. However, when compared to its neighbours, it's just good, not great. 
The rooms are small, very small. If you book through Expedia-Priceline or what have you, don't expect a room with two beds. That costs at least $-- more per night. The beds are comfy enough though. We didn't have duvets, but perhaps that is because of the season. 
We received complimentary WIFI, but I don't think this is standard. It is also very spotty, which is not surprising in a well-constructed historic building. There is a business centre. You better plan ahead to use it. One computer was down and the other one was so slow that it took me over -- minutes to confirm our flight. 
The doormen are lovely and welcoming. They really got me excited to come into such a wonderful hotel. 
The elevators are slower, but it's an historic building, so it met my expectations. 
The maid service was not horrid, but the worst I have had in a four-star hotel. First, we put our toothbrushes in the glasses provided, to avoid having them on the counter. The maid provided new glasses and put our toothbrushes on the counter. 
We had turned the temperature up to --. The maid turned it down to --, making it chilly when we returned from being out all day and night. 
We did some ironing in the morning and didn't put the iron away. Neither did they. 
My new sheet had pink highlighter on it and two tears, which would have been clearly noticeable when placing them on. They were in the top, centre portion of the sheet. 
They do use bleach to wash everything. So if the smell bothers you, this will not be a good place to stay. I didn't mind it, but I definitely noticed it. 
The rooms are tiny, but not the bathroom. I would not suggest two friends share anything but the two full bed rooms. There is hardly anywhere to put your luggage. For a two-person room, only one person can put there luggage on a stand. The other must put it on the windowsill. 
The selections on the TV were very limited. And worse, the channel line up was under the glass of the TV bench (see picture). Also, in our room, the TV was on one side of the room (as the room was too small to put it in the middle). Therefore, only one person could see it up close. Luckily, the other was more of a reader. 
The location was great, if you don't mind walking. But if you're in Chicago, you'll be walking everywhere. It's not close to the L train or the subway train, but it is close to buses that take you there. It is a short walk to any of the tourist attractions. 
There was no pool and no breakfast provided, but you can get room service starting at $--. 
While, I had a good enough stay, I would probably not stay again, as there is so much to choose from in the area.",1,"hotel could amaze short less hotel-populated road might give hotel good review however compare neighbours good great

It's conveniently located to all the good restaurants and just -----min walks to the the museums, shops and other attractions. Chinatown is down the block. The staff was very helpful in suggesting places to eat. (The restuarants inside the hotel were pricey so it's good to eat at the many places around the hotel) The concierge suggested this great waffle spot for breakfast just down the street. We went there twice- it's a small place but great food. Everything was clean and the hotel really makes sure they honor your requests when you check in. We had a street view which was nice although the window was drafty so it felt cold at times. The beds are soft and comfortable and the double bed room we had was very spacious. 
I did see on other reviews that you can hear doors slam and hear loud voices and we found this to be true the first night. The doors do slam shut so you can hear them constantly. I thought maybe it's just that people today lack thoughtfulness in closing a door quietly but a couple times I stepped out the room and before I could turn, the door had slam shut. We could also hear the loud party down the hall the first night. 
Other than that the hotel is a great place to stay. Self parking is the way to go if you don't mind no in-out privileges. The metro is right there but really walking is much easier and you see more of the neighborhood. Walking around we found a great place called Asian Spice.

Lobby: Small but efficient. Located on the --th floor. Staffs were friendly and answered my questions promptly. Was given breakfast vouchers and drink vouchers since I was staying at the Club Level.

18957,"I stayed at the Royalton for two nights in October ----. We were in town for a wedding so we did not spend much time there. It is a very chic, ultracool hotel. It's dark, sleek and you really feel hip walking into the lobby. Funny thing about the lobby is, you can walk right by the front desk and not even know it. The front desk is recessed in an alcove down a long hall from the front door. The staff was nice and welcoming as we arrived.
The 'Standard' room was very nice. It was a long-ish room, with the bed on one end and a sofa-desk area on the other. There was a large (~--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""") LCD TV mounted on the wall between the two areas so that you can either watch from the bed or the sofa. Furnishings were very modern in a neutral concrete gray scheme. In lieu of bedside tables, there were 'nooks' on either side of the bed with lights to illuminate each side. In addition to those lights, there were lamps in the sofa area as well as recessed lighting over the bed.
Bathroom was surprisingly decadent with a mirrored changing room-dressing area (floor to ceiling mirrors) with a counter to spread out all your various toiletries. The actual toilet-sink-shower area was floor to ceiling slate tile and glass door separating the shower area (no bathtub).
The only downfall of the room was its location and view, or lack thereof. We weren't on a very high floor and our window overlooked the alley behind. So we just kept our drapes shut which didn't matter because it was a dark room (hardly any light coming in) and it happened to be a rainy weekend. 
The lobby area was pretty swanky. Long sofas and open fireplace with electronica music in the background. Great place for pre-wedding cocktails.
Overall, I enjoyed my stay there. It was in a good location so it would be easy to get around the city. Next time I will definitely request a higher floor that had a better view (especially for the price).",1,"stay royalton two night october town wed spend much time chic ultracool hotel dark sleek really feel hip walk lobby funny thing lobby walk right front desk even know front desk recess alcove long hall front door staff nice welcome arrived.

On the night before we had hoped to enjoy a meal in their superior restaurant (one of two), we were informed that the restaurant would be closed due to a private party. The general manager spent a great deal of time with us recommending other choices in the nearby area, and his suggestions proved to be spectacular. We chose a restaurant in Los Gatos which was one of the better meals we have had in a long time. 
We especially enjoyed spending time on the patio area where very comfortable chairs and couches were sheltered from the sun by wide umbrellas during the day and heated by stunning gas-fired heaters in the evening. The food and drinks served on the patio were first rate and reasonably priced for resort food. 
Also impressive was the dedication and care exhibited by the entire staff.

If you don't mind being instructed on the finer points of check in times (uh. -:--?) and room availability by a unwelcoming front desk, then this might go better for you than it did for us.
If you are staying for a convention, perhaps you will be treated better. Because it matters not that you are Kimpton members. Yes, WE GET IT.
When we were eventually offered a room, we were told by the front desk supervisor that he had moved another guest to another hotel. HUH? To find room for us? But the room was vacant already, so where was this guest before you moved them to another hotel to make room for us? Uh, and we had just been told ten minutes earlier that NO ROOMS were available at that time. So, the mystery guests were hidden away in the closet?
Never mind, thank goodness we love Kimptons, because another Kimpton in Chicago took over our reservation at our request and salvaged our long weekend.
Never again at Palomar. This was reinforced after we received a rather crisp email reply from the GM of this property, challenging our account of our check in experience.

Perfect Location: I prefer Union Square over any other area of the city. Much more centrally located than the Wharf where most tourists seem to stay. VERY close to all the Union Square shopping and restaurants. Cable car runs right next to the hotel on Powell street.
Service: From check-in to housekeeping this is a highlight of this property. One of my buttons on a sportcoat I brought came off one evening. I had it laid on my desk. To my surprise after the housekeeper had cleaned the next day she had sewn the button back on! Now that is way beyond any expected service. Doormen are great for hailing cabs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just completed a stay at the Grand Hyatt San Francicisco and I have nothing but compliments for the way the staff handled our special needs during this trip.
This was the first time traveling for my friend since she had a stroke a year ago.She has limited mobility now and requires an ADA room. I wanted to be close to here so we asked for an ADA room with and adjoining room for me.This was handled well by the Grand Hyatt San Francisco(I contacted them directly and they were very helpful)and I was sent an email confirmation listing my requests.
There was some confusion with the reservation(which was caused by a third party calling to confirm our reservation)which had us in three rooms instead of two. This was taken care of with no trouble by the FDR with the third """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""phantom room """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""taken off the reservation with no problem.
Our first room was on the -th floor was exactly the set up requested. However it was very noisy so I asked to be moved. The hotel was full so I was told they would move us the next day to a higher floor=which they did.The second set of rooms did not have a roll in shower but Housekeeping brought up a bath bench which worked out pretty well. Both rooms were very clean and I really enjoyed the new bed in my room. It was much quieter.
There is construction(new MUNI station) in the Union Square area that starts at - a.m. so the noise-road detours is going to be a problem for all the hotels in that area
A couple of standout staff members made our stay wonderful. First of was a Bellman named Hal. His kindness and consideration were remarkable. All the bellman and Valet staff were great but Hal went above and beyond and his help was much appriciated.
Dave in the Grand Club makes all of the guests feel like returning friends.All of the staff members in the Grand Club are pretty great. One of the best I have been to in the USA.
I am forwarding this to The General Manager of the Grand Hyatt San Francisco via Facebook with the hope that the staff memebers mentioned (as well as the entire staff)are commended for their great work.And to thank the hotel for helping to make a challenging stay comfortable.",0,"would like preface trip report say grand hyatt san francisco one best hotel stayrd regard recognition hyatt gold passport diamond member property ghsf make happy choose loyal hyatt.

26346,"Located at --- East --th Street. It’s between -nd and -rd Avenues. This --+ floor hotel is very pleasant. We booked a one bedroom suite with King. This was essentially two rooms, one with a king size bed, en suite bathroom, loads of closet space. 
The separate sitting room had a fold out double couch, and a little kitchenette. The kitchenette had cooker, large fridge-freezer, microwave, dishwasher and sink. There was a large TV in both rooms. 
There was also a little storage room with enough space for all suitcases and the ironing board was kept here too. There was also hanging closet space in this storage room.
The suite had everything required for a comfortable stay. Room Safe, phones, lots of good lighting a desk and chair, internet access was an optional extra. The bathroom had a decent bath and good shower. Toiletries and towels were plentiful and replenished as needed. There was a hair drier in the bathroom. There was also the dreaded mini bar, but more of that later!
Hotel reception is bright and modern. Reception and concierge staff are friendly and professional. There is no bar at this hotel. There is free flowing iced tea and fresh fruit available from the reception counter, a nice touch but unnecessary I felt. The one time I did go to try some iced tea there were no little plastic cups available.
On the second floor there is a fitness suite but we never had time to look for it never mind try it out. There is also some kind of Spa treatments available but I’m not sure if these are in-room or whether there is a separate spa treatment room.
The hotel seems to organise weekly meet and greet sessions with their guests. We got an invite to this but could not attend. A nice touch I thought.
Another nice touch is the complimentary morning newspaper and yet another is the guest survey which they email to you very shortly after you arrive home.
Next door is the Barking Dog restaurant where you can sit and eat or order room service from. We did neither as the menu did not entice us enough. 
On our last day we considered the Barking Dog for breakfast but with only - tables occupied at --am, we decided against it and went around the corner to Gemini Diner which was very good with a varied breakfast menu but unfortunately a sullen staff.
I requested a room on a high floor and got floor --. I would not consider this a high floor in a -- floor building. However the room we got, while it had no views to speak of was fairly quiet as we were not facing directly onto a street.
The main King size bed was amazingly comfortable. I loved it. There was a pillow menu, which is probably a good idea. We did try the Swedish pillow but were unimpressed, however this did not spoil our stay and the fault was probably ours for not being pillow geeks.
The ‘sitting room’ was a much more pleasant cool temp than the bedroom during our stay in August when the temperatures outside were quite high. We could not manage to adjust the temp in the bedroom and yes we could have called reception but to be honest it didn’t bother us that much, just one night was particularly sticky, after that it was ok.
Location of the hotel was good for us but might not suit everyone who wants to shop a lot and drop bags back to the hotel at intervals. It’s about a -- minute walk along --th street to -th avenue and a further - to Macys. It’s on the same street as the Empire State Building. For the purpose of our trip - sightseeing, the location was fine.
In any case getting a cab was very easy and cheap and the concierge was always on hand to hail a cab
Nearby there is a very good selection of local shops and mini markets selling everything you could possibly need? Just across the road and down a little is a Duane Reade pharmacy.
If I had to complain it would be about two things. The first was the mini bar. I really dislike a mini bar especially in a hotel where the items can be purchased much cheaper locally. But I mostly dislike them because I am invariably charged on my final bill for items I have not taken from the bar. This time $-- was added to my bill for mini bar. OK, so it won’t bankrupt me, but that’s not the point. When I told the receptionist that I did not take anything from the mini bar she politely told me that she would remove the charge. This did not alleviate my embarrassment however. I would have preferred the incorrect charge not be there in the first place.
I believe hotels should give guests the option of having-not having a mini bar. This would be a very simple thing for housekeeping to organise.
The second issue I had was with the housekeeping lady who repeatedly told us that we were not displaying our ‘do not disturb’ sign correctly. She insisted on day one that we always display the sign outside our door. I thought that this was rude and also unnecessary. I have not come across this previously in other decent hotels. 
Also, on the last day when we were just getting ready to vacate our room at --am (checkout is --pm), she knocked on our door and asked us what time we were leaving at.
The reason our sign was not displayed correctly is that the darn thing kept falling off the door handle as it wasn’t a very well designed sign. If the Affinia Dumont place such emphasis on their ‘do not disturb-make me up’ signs then they should have better signs or at least signs that don’t blow off the handle with every puff of air. I have been in a hotel where there is an electrical switch used for this purpose.
It still bugs me that I left her a decent tip, 
Overall though, I would definitely recommend the Affinia Dumont, we had a great time there and the few little annoyances were outweighed by a very pleasant stay.

There is a TV, desk, IPod dock, automatic blinds, and plenty of shelves to make for storage.

I was always sooo tired from the streets of NY that it never bothered me, but anyone with back issues would never make it. The bathroom had two issues. I read about a curtain covering the restroom, which was not the case for corner rooms. We had no curtains seperating us, just the clear sliding door. I have been in some not so private bathrooms in my time traveling, but this was the worst. This door does not have any frost at all, it is completely see through, and has a small dotted design at the bottom, which does nothing privacy wise. I just can't understand this concept of hotels and why they think it is desirable to watch someone else go to the restroom. Just be warned that the door is clear and you can see through it. The other thing with the bathroom was the draining of the shower. We had to put down at least two towels to keep from getting water all over the floor and into the carpet. I believe this causes huge problems with mold because I am allergic to it and felt very symptomatic while there. The first morning we got out fairly late around -:-- PM and when we returned around -:-- PM our room was not clean (the only time this happened for - nights), but around -- mins later we got a call from mission control that when they came by that we had our """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""do not disturb"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sign on and they were unable to clean the room and asked if we needed any extra towels or anything else they could help us with, which I thought was a nice touch. 
On the fourth floor you will find two bars. We did hang out for two drinks on a Sat around - and the bar was fairly busy. We had no problem getting a drink and they are pricey like every other bar in Manhatten. There is an outdoor area rooftop as well, which we never used because of the weather, but would be great in the summer. The area they turn into a night club atmosphere at night is also on four. We passed by several times, but never went in because I am not a huge fan of techno which it seemed that they only played. Dohyo is also located on four, they supply the free muffins from ----AM there, there are several computers to use free of charge, and a concierge. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Yobot"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is located in the lobby when you first walk in, but be aware that it can NOT store all luggage. Luckily one of the doormen told us our bags were too big and he was kind enough to store them for us, and arrange for a taxi once it was our time to leave. Yotel also has there own car service that they use where you can ride in a black town car or escalade for an upgrade charge if you want to ride VIP. We never used it, but I thought it was cool that they had it as an option. 
Overall, our stay was great for what we paid to stay there, there is a fairly young crowd staying here (--'s---'s), the best thing about this hotel is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!! There is a CVS -- hour pharmacy right across the street good for any late night munchies or snacks, a subway is also across the street. Times Square is a two block walk. Subway and bus stations are all really close by. There are a lot of food options all around. Broadway shows are within walking distance. We are walkers and we were able to walk to Rockefeller Plaza, Fifth Ave, Grand Central Station, and Central Park from the hotel with no problem. There are always cabs around to catch and there were never any outrageous fees over $-- (accept La Guardia, around $--) getting anywhere we needed to go in Manhatten.

22086,"We stayed at the Hotel Burnham this past weekend in May. The hotel, located at the corner of State and Washington Streets in the Loop, is a stunningly beautiful hotel. The restoration of the hotel has included such intricate details as wrought-iron railings on inner stairwells and elevators. The decor in the lobby is very stylish and modern (a la W Hotels). Each afternoon, the hotel has free wine in the lobby for its guests.
Our room faced State Street, and overlooked the old-line Marshall Field's department store, and a small portion of the Frank Gehry-designed bandshell in Millenium Park. The room, albeit small, was furnished with a very large king bed, wonderful linens, and Aveda bath products. 
The service at the hotel was outstanding. Every bellman, front desk attendant, waiter-waitress and maid we encountered were very friendly and made every effort to assist and make things easier. We were especially impressed with the concierge, Tracy. She gave thoughtful and considered recommendations for restaurants and entertainment (e.g., local blues clubs). Once we had decided on a restaurant (e.g., Gino's East for great deep-dish pizza), she even had discount-special privilege coupons which allowed us to jump ahead in line (a supposed ---minute wait turned into a ---minute wait), or provided other special benefits. (She even managed to get us tickets for a nearly sold-out exhibition at the Museum of Science and Industry). Tracy was excellent!

A hotel with a history, which you can derive not only from the impressing lobby but also from the numerous photographs of celebrities that stayed, filmed or performed in the Fairmont.
The Fairmont Hotel is a majestic building on top of Nob Hill, on of the few buildings that survived the ---- Earthquake almost undamaged.
When we entered our 'Tower room' we where astonished by the views over San Francisco and the Bay. Astonished to a degree that my wife, who has not only problems with heights but also with windows that can't be opened, felt rather uncomfortable.
I decided to ask for a room with windows that can be opened and were, without hesitation, upgraded to a superb suite with a balcony on the backside, unfortunately without a great view. A couple of days later my wife decided to control her 'vertigo' to the utmost and surprised me with a second removal: to the Tower room with bay views again!
Even now the staff was kind, understanding and cooperative.
The Fairmont is located near Powell- and Californiastreet so you can hop on the cablecar any direction you like, if desired after a great breakfast in Cento [a kind of Starbucks, belonging to the Fairmont].

17816,"We stayed at the Sohotel for two nights in July of ----. We would have stayed for our last two nights as well, but unfortunately they were all booked up. I think most of the people writing bad reviews on here are either competitors or just extremely nitpicky, because our stay and experience at the hotel was great. 
I'll start with the negatives of which there were only a few:
Our electric went out a few times in the room; they fixed it quickly, but it went off a few more times over the next few hours whenever we plugged something in. Luckily, we saw the fuse box the staff member used to get it back on, and we just did it ourselves the next few times. Hopefully, they have since fixed the problem.
The only other """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bad"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" thing was the coffee. It just wasn't that good at all. 
Now for the good!
Location is amazing. You are literally a - minute walk from all the best neighborhoods in lower Manhattan. Little Italy: - blocks, Chinatown: --- a block, Lower East Side - East Village: --- blocks, Broadway and shopping: - blocks, the Village ---- blocks--- everything is right there!!! We loved the location, and was one of the main reasons we booked here in the first place. 
The customer service was outstanding. Frank and Ali (hopefully got the names right)were awesome and more than ready to help with our baggage or anything else we needed. I can't think of thier names, but we dealt with the same - or - ladies at the front desk for our whole stay, and they were extremely friendly and helpful with everything... Like I said before, we would have stayed longer, but they were totally booked up. 
Another great thing about this hotel was the price. Compared to the neighboring hotels, they are priced very well. When I was walking around looking for another hotel on our last day, the cheapest thing I could find in Soho was running about $------- a night! For the location, they really do have the best prices in the area- and this is coming from someone who researches his trips extensively. 
One more thing----- the rooms are small. But, really- aren't you going to be out doing stuff all day anyway? Who cares if it's small? The bed was extremely comfortable as well. The only other thing I might recommend is that they get a fold-down ironing board behind the door or something. The big one from the front desk barely fits in the room once your bags and everything is set down, but we made it work. 
Let me state again- we had a great experience at the Sohotel, and are already looking at staying there again in December. The staff, price and location cannot be beat!

The only downside, which has been well documented here is the train-trolley that runs regularly behind the hotel. If you bring earplugs (or ask the hotel for them) you should be OK.

Rooms
Here is my complaint. The room set up was the weirdest setup I've ever seen. It was a fairly large King room that had a couch and chairs. You had a large bed on the fall wall facing a wall about --' in front of it. The TV was on top of a dresser that was on the opposite side of the room, same side on the bed, however you would have to lie on your side to see it. The bed is extremely low to the ground, so even trying to watch it was painful on the neck. At least the reception was good. The other big peeve, the alarm clock was on the OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM from the bed! I almost couldn't believe it. It seemed like whoever designed these rooms didn't stop to think about who would be staying in it. They had to bring a cord to my room so I could actually put it next to my bed. VERY WEIRD!
The room was very clean, shower had good water pressure, and the fridge and microwave was a nice touch. If the room had made sense would have been a more pleasant stay. The walls seemed pretty thin as I could hear TV's, and one of my colleagues heard someone snoring in the middle of the night! Hotel seemed to be used a lot by the military and by airline staff.
Service
Everyone was very nice at the front desk. A few of my requests seemed to take way longer than they should have (directions), which would be fine if I hadn't been running late. I was also supposed to be keyed to the Executive Floor since I was a member of their rewards club. That didn't work. Seemed helpful, but again wasn't the fastest.
Amenities
There was a nice looking outdoor pool, but way too cold to test it out. The exercise room looked decent, had several machines. They also had a cafe, I didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.
Locations
Very close to the airport off the access road. A ton of restaurants right on the access road or across the street (left lane, use the turnaround). Because it was right on the highway, was a bit too much noise for my taste. Try and get a room not facing the highway.

Upon arrival at -:--, we, and many others in the lobby, were told our room wasn't ready and they were still cleaning them. We went out for a while and came back at - and the room still wasn't ready. At that point it was unacceptable and it took a nasty comment from me for a manager to come out and re-arrange our room. The room was roomy and clean so no complaint there. The next day, after running the marathon and coming back our room keys did not work and we had to go to the lobby where we were told we couldn't go back to our room because of renovations. We would have to move rooms, however none of the rooms were ready because they were being cleaned. After some more nasty comments from us and the fact our luggage was still in the room, they """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""allowed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" us to stay in the room until another was ready. Of course then our keys stopped working again and we had to go back down to the lobby...

Similarly, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, and Herald Square (think Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade) are a pretty easy walk North.

We ate in the restaurant which i would say was the only mild negative point, the waiters being a bit patronising.

Returned from dinner -- nothing had been done. We called the front desk again and were told nothing could be done because housekeeping had left for the day.

We then went back downstairs and asked to see the manager. He rudely told us the room was okay and nothing could be done.

23305,"We stayed here just for a night, for its proximity to Penn Station (about a ten minute walk).
It's a good, central location close to a lot of attractions (Empire State could be seen from the window) and transportation - many within walking distance - earlier that day we had dropped our bags off and walked south to SoHo and later on we walked north to Columbus circle. So if you don't mind walking (and that's probably the best way to see anywhere) then the location should suit you just fine.
As for the cost, at around -- dollars (before taxes - after taxes --) it was just about the cheapest thing in New York we could find for two people. For the location and quality this isn't a bad deal at all. The room was clean and decently kept, with a sink and a mirror, though the bathroom was shared. The bed was decently comfy though a little on the softer side. The decor of the hotel was a little dated but almost in a charming circa ----s kind of way. The staff were nice, and had a convenient bag check service if you arrive before check in, or check out but need somewhere to drop your bags.
However, it bears noting that the Hotel itself could use some renovations beyond decor. The soundproofing wasn't great and the walls were quite thin. If you're used to packing earplugs when you travel then this won't be a big deal at all.
In short, one of the only major downsides was noise. Street noise is unavoidable in New York, but hearing the adjacent room's TV isn't. Either way this is hardly a big enough downside for which to avoid the place. Another downside was that the hot water took quite a while to circulate and the shower took a few minutes to heat up. Again, a rather petty complaint.
In short - it's a very no frills kind of hotel that's a little outdated in a few ways. But if you're going to see the city and want a centrally located place just to crash that is better than a hostel, then this should suit you just fine. Especially if you're a student on a budget...",0,"stay night proximity penn station ten minute walk).

The staff are all super friendly and very service oriented...for example, they run to the door to open it for you! 
The room decor is full of clean lines with built-in cabinetry. We liked the pillow menu, although we didn't take advantage of it. The communal """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" areas were a real eye-opener, with complimentary snacks (e.g. whole fresh fruit, plus chocolate covered raisins and malt balls in glass jars on the counter). The fridge was also stocked with free bottled water and the freezer had individual serving sizes of Haagen Dazs ice cream...yum! 
We had dinner at the Copperleaf restaurant and were impressed by the quality of the farm-to-table cuisine and the wine selection. This is the kind of restaurant that serves you an amuse bouche beforehand and a small sweet bite afterwards - a lovely touch! The complimentary continental breakfast the next morning was nice: fruit salad, yogurt, oatmeal (with lots of topping choices), a platter of different salamis, smoked salmon, caperberries, pastries, breads and bagels (with a toaster and cream cheese). There is also a staff member who is constantly refreshing the breakfast items and clearing away the used plates. Right at the end of the breakfast period, they also brought out a super-nice fruit platter with plump blackberries, raspberries and fresh figs! We really enjoyed that =)
Fantastic value for the price and level of service...we will definitely stay here again if we are using Seatac.",0,"boyfriend stay one night fly back nyc impressed hotel seem quite new architecture whistler-west coast lot expose beam glass organic materials...it give relax calm ambience staff super friendly service oriented...for example run door open

12893,"I have just returned from a - night stay at the Argonaut. I am pretty fussy about the hotels I select, as I often travel alone. I was looking forward to the hotel, and it lived up to all my expectations. I not only felt completely safe, but never out of place. There was a quiet luxury here that was very comfortable.
I found the location to be ideal. The hotel is right on Fisherman's Wharf, which as other reviewers have stated is touristy and tacky, but the hotel is at the very end of the Wharf, so you are removed from all of that. My room was on the side which faced the park (highly recommended), so from my window I had a fabulous view of the cable car turn-around, Ghirardelli Square and the Golden Gate Bridge. 
The hotel could not have been more convenient. There is a streetcar - blocks away, the cable car is right next door, trips to Alcatraz are a five minute walk, Greens vegetarian restaurant was a -- minute walk, the Hertz car rental was - blocks away etc. 
I had been a little fearful that the nautical theme might go too far as I had stayed in another Kimpton Hotel in Chicago (the Allegro) where you needed sunglasses and Dramamine to combat the garishly bright colors and striped decor. However, I found the Argonaut to be soothing yet dramatic. The bed was spectacularly comfortable, and the room was very large, not only by city standards, but by any standards. 
While the staff were not the most cheerful people I've met, they were helpful. The concierge was able to get me tickets to Alcatraz despite it being sold out during my stay. There was an erroneous mini bar charge on my bill, which the front desk staff rectified immediately upon my request. And the bell staff were friendly and efficient. I had them store my bags after I checked out and when I came back several hours later with my rental car, I drove right up to the front door, handed my baggage ticket out the window to the bellman, who retrieved my luggage, opened the car and loaded it without my even getting out of the car.
My stay at The Argonaut got my vacation off to a great start. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",0,"return night stay argonaut pretty fussy hotel select often travel alone look forward hotel live expectation felt completely safe never place quiet luxury comfortable.

The location couldn't have been better.

21081,"This is the first time I've ever written a review like this but I've appreciated the warnings others have given me on this site so here it goes... My business colleague and I chose this place based on positive things we had heard and the great location. When we arrived, there was an odd odor (think kitty litter) in the check-in area and one of our rooms was not ready. When the rooms were finally ready, we were told we had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs to our rooms. No elevator. No ramp. No one to help with the bags. What a first impression. When we got to our room, the front desk person said we were in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""upgraded rooms"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" by the pool. The rooms were clean but fit for someone who was there to party as the first view was large bottles of alcohol and condoms on the snack platter. Since we were there for business, we did not think this room was the best fit for us. We then left the room to have lunch by the pool. The staff was so aloof and unhelpful but we stuck it out anyway and remorsefully ate among the men ogling the topless women around the pool. This was around -pm on a Weds. We left and went to a business meeting and returned - hours late to request a change of room since the music playing from the pool was so loud. The reservations person on the phone was very kind and helpful but the rooms we were put in were dark, stains on the carpet, red lights in the bathroom and you could hear the street noise as if the windows were open. It was far worse than the first room. So my colleague and I decided to leave the hotel altogether. The front desk felt a little bad that we were canceling our reservation but the parking guys insisted we pay $-- for the -- minutes we had parked at the hotel the entire day. Shocked by the request, we handed them our credit card and said what a horrible way to treat unhappy guests at your hotel. Then the parking guys told us that their credit card machine was broken and we had to go get cash, pay the $-- and then we would get the car. We could not believe it! We refused and after a lot of back and forth, they finally let us go without paying the parking. We could not wait to get out of there!! We went to the Beverly Hills Hilton and felt like we were in heaven there after our time at the deplorable Roosevelt. On our way out, there was a couple in the elevator who told us they had changed rooms twice but were still unhappy. Oh we could relate!!

I am going to try and sum up what made this hotel so special.

Of course you pay to stay in the room but when you add in all of the extras....its a steal!! We checked all of the kids into the kids camp and were able to enjoy the adult only pool. The service was something that I have never experienced before....even at the four seasons. The staff waited on us hand and foot, always had drinks, towels etc. The kids received welcome bags when they checked in. I dont understand how anyone has complaints about this hotel. I read reviews before I go so I am prepared for anything. Literally all - families said this was the most relaxing vacation they had ever taken and the best hotel ever.

We parked at the top of the block and they came running! Thanks Eddie! (The location is VERY busy...so be prepared.) There is an opulent entrance and a warm welcome at the front desk. 
We were given a room that does not face Powell and it was quiet in terms of outside noise. However, the walls are very thin and all noises around will travel through to you. Our bathroom window did not close and we found it cold in there at night.
Expect small rooms here. )It was built a long time ago for a generation that raised - kids in a two bedroom house, right?) Anyone who has stayed in this city knows that this is pretty common with the hotel chains.
That being said, here is the skinny: Nice shower products, very hard bed. Easy to use TV and very good cleaning staff. Thanks Feng! There is no coffee maker in any room, so expect long line-ups at the Starbucks (Thankfully, there is no shortage if these here...)
Hint: If you want a quiet floor, ask for a lower one. A few we talked to complained of the noise higher up.
The location here cannot be beat! This is the reason people stay here, I am certain. The bar downstairs is well-equipped and you will likely be given a few complimentary drink tickets for your stay. (Bonus)
There is an in-room safe however, no bathrobes here. The workout area is nice and very well-equipped with modern machines. 
I think this hotel reflects its management. I have never met a GM like Jim. We talked for a few moments in the lobby and during our conversation, he sees a lady carting a heavy bag up the stairs. He excuses himself politely and then jumps to her aid, carrying the heavy bag a few more flights! I think this says a lot about the kind of people that work here.

I was shocked at how small this hotel is in comparison to other Courtyards-hotels I have stayed at in Manhattan and other large cities.

31538,"I just returned from a three-night stay at the Hotel Icon and was very impressed overall. My friends and I shared two rooms in this renovated classic building on the northerly end of downtown Houston. We were in town for a ballgame at Minute Maid Park, which was about a ten-minute walk from the hotel. The Icon is also located next to a stop on Houston's new light rail line and is close to downtown freeways. Do note that if you're staying here on the weekend that downtown Houston isn't yet a ---- hub of activity despite efforts to develop one. Finding coffee both Saturday and Sunday mornings was a challenge. However, drinking and dining options within a short drive were plentiful, and we found some good pubs and bars south along Main Street that satisfied our needs.
The room I stayed in had two queen beds, and ample seating. The desk doubled as the nightstand between the two beds, which was unique but fine. There was also ample storage in a closet and three-drawer dresser. The bathroom is huge and amply lit, and had a spacious shower- tub with good water pressure. There was also a spacious marble counter in the bathroom and multiple large mirrors in the room and bath, which would be handy for primping if I did that!
One thing of note: the hotel is going for a retro ----s-----s look while positioning itself as a --st Century hotel with modern amenities. The color schemes and furnishings are different from anything I've ever seen in a modern hotel. However, I think it mostly succeeds in its modern and classic stylings despite a few very minor hiccups (the free in-hotel wi-fi didn't seem to work).
We didn't avail ourselves of many of the hotel's amenities except the valet parking, which was prompt and reliable, if not a touch on the pricey side. The hotel bar in the lobby looked fine with a handful of local beers on tap, and the hotel restaurant looked the part.

I stayed a total of - days will visiting my daughter while she was in town from college. The -st room I was given the floor in the room was wet! AND MUSKY OF WETNESS! The next afternoon I informed the front desk of the condition of the room and he gave me a total of - keys to try - rooms to see which room I would like. I was able to unlock each room and found that each of those rooms was already occupied. WOW – yes it happened for real. He then looked in the computer told the shuttle driver to go with me and check out -- rooms. He gave the driver a master key. The driver knocked and entered each room – for which each room was occupied. A couple was on the bed having intercourse when the driver knocked on the door. We went back down to the front desk and he told us try a room on the -th floor because room has not been occupied in the last - days – so we tried that one. It was unoccupied – so I took that one. The walls are very thin because you can hear the people in the next room talking clear as day and if you are in the hallway with your kids and someone in a room is having intercourse – you will hear it clear as day word for word whatever the parties are saying because the shuttle driver and I heard a couple as we were walking in the hallway to check on rooms. This is mostly because the space between the bottom of the door and the floor is a very BIG gap. Housekeeping did not clean my room until after -pm and that was after I asked the front desk to have someone clean it while I was gone from -am – -pm.

Whilst it was perfect for sightseeing in the Grant Park - aquarium, planetarium and museum area, it was a little out of the way for the rest and for night life etc. We found ourselves most nights just ending up in the hotel restaurant because we were so tired from walking all day and hadn't the energy to walk a ways to find another decent restaurant, which was very disappointing.

The climate control in meeting rooms is terrible. The housekeeping and room maintenace are problematic. There was something gooey on the floor of my bathroom and a non-working electrical outlet. Neither was tended to, despite promises from the front desk. The next day I picked up the city magazine in the room and found a huge piece of gum stuck to the bottom. In addition, there are signs of wear, including badly stained grout in the sink and tub. I reported the smell of gas in the hallway. It turned out to be a chemical smell from a nearby factory, but no one got back to me to tell me. And when there was a mistake on my bill, instead of taking my word for the fact that my group had breakfast coupons (I had one to show them), I was made to stand at the desk while the clerk leafed through all the previous day's breakfast receipts. And then our group's master billing seemed to fall through--our credit cards were charged instead.

24539,"We decided to go to Charlotte to do a little shopping and have dinner with friends. Since the Ritz is a new choice we thought that we would give it a try. We reserved on line - the breakfast package- the room rate included breakfast for - and valet parking. When I made the reservation it asked if we wanted feather or foam pillows. I requested foam as I have an allergy.
We checked in around - pm on a Friday. The lobby was empty and the front desk clerk was pleasant but seemed disorganized. The bell man was very good and pointed out the hotel's amenities as he took us to tthe room. The room itself was very clean. The decor is very old world gentleman's club. 
We went down to the lobby bar to have some lunch. The bartender was overwhelmed with - couples in the bar area. She said that usually she isn't busy and spends her time slicing fruit so the number of people there was """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a lot to handle'. We had a burger and a quesadilla. The burger was fine but not special. The quesadilla was really bad. The cheese tasted old and the quesadilla was on a plate with no garnish. There was a side plate with sour cream, guacamole and salsa. None of these items was particularly good. I had prosecco and my boyfriend had a beer. The total was almost $-- for very average food and the service was disorganized at best. 
When we returned to the room I realized that it was all feather. I called the front desk and was put on hold for - minutes. I hung up at that point and called the housekeeping number. They sent up - foam pillows, that was it. I had to ask her to remove the feather ones .
My boyfriend took a shower and found the water pressure to be very low but the temperature was acceptable to him. I prefer a hotter shower but understand that many hotels are hesitant to raise the temperature for both safety and cost reasons. A housekeeper came by at -.-- asking if we wanted turn down. I said that we were going to be in the room for another couple of hours but I would like some shower gel( the only bottle was used during the BF's shower). She said ok , gave me some and left. She was pleasant. I then prepared for dinner. I too found the water pressure to be very weak. 
We went out to dinner and returned about --. The lobby was a zoo. As other reviews have noted, the hotel is across from the Epicenter. There is a lot going on and a lot of noise. There was a jazz combo in the lobby. They were very loud and not very good,. We went to the bar for a drink and it was hard to have any conversation over the music. The evening bartender was very good but he expressed his frustration with the bar set up. He explained that he had asked management several times to change the way the register is set up etc as it is hard to work. He seemed very professional and I am surprised that they wouldn't take his suggestion as the bar did seem to be set up for only one person to work ast a time- not very efficient on a busy night. 
We went to bed. I found the mattress very soft and uncomfortable but as that is a matter of preference I can't really complain. 
Breakfast- either in room or in BLT was included with our rate. We decided to go down to BLT. The hostess did not say good morning, she did not ask if we prefered a table or booth- nothing. She picked up - menus said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and led us to a table. That was the extent of her hostessing. The package included """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" an American breakfast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". This it turns out is only - items on the menu and no other items ( even those less expensive aren't included). This was confusing to all parties ( we overhead another couple trying to get clarification from their waitress as well). The staff and customers all seemed to be a bit baffled about this. The food was ATROCIOUS. The toast was just bread ( honestly, it was a lot closer to stale bread than toast). The grits were runny and crunchy. We noticed that no one around us ate their grits. The waitress did not ask us anything other than if we were ready for the check. When she brought that she did ask what our day's plans were but honestly at that point it seemed like she was just trying to be friendly before we decided on a tip. 
We went back to the room and prepared to check out. When we did check out ( at least -- minutes later) the breakfast charge had not been put on our bill. The front desk explained that it would have to be added then removed. I said ok and waited while they called the restaurant to get the charge posted. This led to a lot of confusion - i.e. was juice a part of the breakfast, gratuity was-was not included etc. The clerk said that since it would take awhile they would email me my receipt. I received it the next day and was charged $- for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""breakfast overage"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I am not sure if this was juice or the gratuity . 
We retrieved the car from the valet. They were once again excellent and offered us bottled water for our drive. The valet and bellstaff were the highlights of the service. 
We won't be back. It was twice as much as other Charlotte hotels and the room, while very nice was not twice as nice as the Hampton Inn South Park and the service was not half as good as most hotels.",1,"decide go charlotte little shopping dinner friend since ritz new choice think would give try reserved line breakfast package room rate include breakfast valet park make reservation ask want feather foam pillow request foam allergy.

The room was on the first floor and when we got to the room we went to close the drapes, and noticed we had a pleasant view of the alley and a row of garbage cans.

12535,"This will be my fifth time in two years staying at the Hotel Stanford, and each time it just gets better and better. The hotel is, in my opinion in the perfect spot city wise (Located on -- West --nd Street,) It’s right by the Empire State Building, but still a good ten blocks away from Times Square, so it’s close enough to get to if you want to check out any shows, but far enough to get away from all the hustle and bustle.
The hotel has a little café attached to it, where you are entitled to a free breakfast each morning when you show your room key. It’s not much, just bagels and donuts, but it’s still delicious and one of the few places to still offer that. The rooms include a fridge, a small walk in closet, a flat screen TV and a safe.
The hotel is in the process of updating all their rooms, which is great.
What I love most about this hotel is that the staff are extremely friendly and now even remember me when I go back, which I think says a lot. I admit I’m a bit of a princess when it comes to hotels, so the main thing for me was that it was clean – which it was.
This hotel is nothing fancy, but it’s a lovely warm, comfortable place to stay and I have felt incredibly safe there and when in the surrounding area – even at night. Also, the rooms are extremely quiet when considering the location. I have stayed in Times Square before and after staying here, I’d never do that again!! The rooms I have stayed in have only ever had views of the wall next door, but that has become a sort of running joke with my friends and I when we stay there now, so we don’t mind it at all (we actually like that it makes the room nice and dark for us when we go to sleep.)

Upon reading most reviews this is pretty well all I seem to hear about, and please don't me wrong the location is amazing. 
You are basically right in Time Square, a minutes walk from the Time Square subway hub, and a few blocks from nearly every major theater on Broadway. Within ----- minutes in any direction you have the Empire State Building, -- Rock, New York Library, Macy's, Time Square, Bryant Park, Broadway, MOMA, and on and on. 
For whatever extra I paid for the rooms to be right in the heart of the city I made up in the first day for what I would have spent on cabs carting around everywhere. 
However I find far to few reviews give praise to the hotel itself. 
The check staff are very friendly and made sure that I secured a room that suited my needs, they were even kind enough to upgrade me to a room with a nice view on a higher floor. 
The Rooms were very nice, the beds were newer and very comfortable with a series of different pillow types which is appreciated. 
There was very little street noise or anything that would have interrupted my sleep which can be a rarity among New York hotels.

The man downstairs sent us a hosekeeper who said she wasn't working there and she just dropped off three towels (which we soon found out were dirty,too), telling us that we had to make our own beds. A friend of us living in NYC called the property Management in NYC at -----------, and after being disconnected while speaking with Dan, he spoke with Carlos, who put him on hold for over ten minutes. He called back and spoke with Scott, who said Carlos wasn't availabe; however, Scott assured that the room would be made right away. We left and when we came back at --:--pm, the room was still filthy and unmade. We were offered to take a cab (at our exepense) and go to another apartment on --rd Street, which we declined, because it was late, we were exhasuted and we feared that that place might be just as dirty. This morning our friend Marco called Carlos, who said he was still investigating this matter (he shouldn't apply for a job at the local Police station, I would say). I asked him what investigation he had been making and he told me that he wanted to speak with the people at the Times Square """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Palace"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (no name was ever more fitting).

Marco persisted and called back, only to hear Carlos say the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""investigation"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" had produced the following result: the housekeeper said that she has cleaned the room and therefore there was no refund.

25113,"...this one's pretty good.
I've stayed at the Seatac Radisson a couple of times now, for either a quick business trip or a close-to-the-airport stopover, and both stays were better than adequate. You don't usually expect much at aiport hotels, but this place is pretty decent.
LOCATION
The hotel is on International Blvd, literally right across the street from the airport. You can walk to the airport if you want to. Both times I've taken the shuttle, but would certainly walk if it seemed like the shuttle was running behind. The area is primarly hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and parking facilities (and, um, the occasional """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""gentlemen's club""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""). If you're driving, there's a Safeway with a pharmacy not too far away. Anyway, it's ideally located for a preflight hotel stay.
ROOMS
The rooms are pretty nice. (Many Radissons I've stayed at previously have inspired me to rename the chain """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ratisson"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" due to their general griminess; this one is much better.) I stayed in a king-bed room; the workstation was large (great since I was working), the WiFi was free, and the furniture and decor were tasteful. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the room was quiet. In short, it's pefect for catching up on business before you have to fly out the next day.
FACILITIES-LOBBY
The lobby is functional; not huge, but not tiny. There's a restaurant that wasn't too bad (for lunch, anyway), and there's a comfortable bar-lounge where you can grab a drink and watch the Mariners lose horribly to whoever they happen to be playing that day. It's not fancy, and don't look for a party scene there, but it's perfectly adequate.
Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I can't comment.
There's a pool, but I didn't use it, so I'm not sure what it's like.
STAFF
The staff was very helpful and cheerful. On one of my stays, I arrived *way* before check-in time, and they were happy to find me a room that was ready early... which allowed me to get a lot more work done than I would have otherwise. That was great. 
They answered all of my questions about local services, and did so with a smile. In short, the staff greatly enhanced my stay, which is always a nice surprise.
SUMMARY
If you're a business traveler and you need a good place to stay near the airport, this is top-notch. It's a particurlay good deal if you get it through hotwire or priceline. The staff is helpful and friendly, the rooms are nice, and you can't get closer to the airport without sleeping at the terminal.",0,"one's pretty good.

6146,"We picked the Courtyard when we wanted a comfortable place in the Ballantyne area of Charlotte. It turned out to be very satisfactory, despite the fact that work going on in the public areas made the entrance a cramped hallway. They managed to provide coffee and cookies neatly organized on one side, and they had junk food of various kinds for sale beside the reception counter. The service was great: All the staff weren't just polite, they were really pleasant and helpful.
Here's what I liked:
- The room was spacious and clean. It had a nice desk with a second pullout desk below it so you could make a comfortable office set-up.
- The free wifi internet worked well.
- The location was really convenient. Not scenic by any means, but close to restaurants, shops, the gas station, and the freeway.
- The website warned of the lobby renovation IN ADVANCE so I was prepared to find it closed off.
- The indoor swimming pool looked nice, though I didn't actually go in.
Here's what I didn't like so much:
- The bathroom was small, and split into a washbasin outside, loo and shower inside. (But it was well-maintained and worked fine.)
- The room had only one chair, which I would not have noticed if I'd been alone. But not so nice for couples.

13705,"I stayed at Hotel Monaco because I was sent to Seattle for work, and it was located close to the office. I got a decent rate of $----night for a room with a King bed.
The hotel is definitely fairly well kept up and the service is friendly. I like the fact that they have wine served in the lobby between -P--P, and coffee and tea served between -A--A, courtesy of the hotel. However, I found that the lobby gets pretty packed with guests wanting their free coffee-wine on the weekends so there's no place to sit down. Also, one morning they ran out of coffee in the lobby, and we had to wait -- minutes for them to bring out some more.
The hotel's restaurant, Sazerac, is a good restaurant with pretty good drinks. It was convenient being able to get a nice dinner in the hotel. Just be sure to make reservations for dinner, since it can get pretty busy there during Happy Hour on the weeknights.
The thing I wasn't so happy about with the hotel are its thin walls. I could hear my neighbors talking and moving about, and could really feel the neighbor's kids jumping on the bed. It makes you wonder if there would be any privacy for a romantic weekend, if you get my drift. Also, the doors on the tv cabinet were askew.
Also, I'm not sure why it's so difficult to find a decent workout room in a hotel. I tried out Hotel Monaco's fitness room, and found that the equipment was pretty out-dated. The one treadmill in the room wasn't evening working, and they charged guests if they wanted to hook headsets into the tv monitors attached to the machines. There were no mats to sit and stretch on and the quarters were tight. I'm accustomed to cycling machines, but the resistance of Monaco's cycling machine was really off, and I had a difficult time cycling with just a resistance of -, which should be really easy.
Although the goldfish rentals appear to appeal to some, it seems a little abusive to me. I was uncomfortable with seeing the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""used"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" goldfish, left out in front of the rooms, once the guests were done with them. Maybe Hotel Monaco should just set up a nice, well-kept stationary fish tank in the lobby for all to enjoy. I bet the fish would be happier, and isn't that the point of the fish tanks? It's supposed to be for animal lovers.
Overall, Hotel Monaco was a comfortable place to stay. I like it's smaller size, compared to the Sheraton and Hyatt down the street. It gives it a more cozy feel, and probably encourages more personal service.

28874,"The traffic noise I was able to hear from my room was louder than the noise at any NYC hotel in which I have stayed in my lifetime (and I've probably stayed ---+ nights in NYC, not including a short stint where I rented an apartment in the city for a couple of months). My guess as to why the noise was so bad was that I was given a room on the -rd floor that was situated on a corner overlooking Madison and --th, so I could hear the noise from two different directions. (I called the front desk a few minutes after checking into my room to ask for a room on a higher floor, but they told me the only room available was one that was on the -th floor, so I declined to switch, although in retrospect it might have been worth a shot). 
Even though I had an important business conference to attend in the morning, I couldn't fall asleep until about -:-- a.m. (The only thing that helped was a sleep-sounds app that I downloaded using the hotel's free Wi-Fi). Then, at -:-- a.m., I woke up to the sound of faucets turning on and off water from the room above mine (it was so loud that I literally jumped up thinking someone was in my room). This noise continued for about -- minutes--- the water turning onnnnnnnnnnnnnn, the water turning off, the water turning onnnnnnnnnnnn, the water turning off, etc. I didn't fall back asleep until about -:-- a.m., and I had to wake up a short time after that.
Needless to say, I was exhausted at my conference the next morning. 
I do NOT recommend staying at this hotel unless you can guarantee a room on a high floor and-or a room that does not overlook Madison (and even then, I am not sure how to deal with the problem of the noise from the faucets). It would probably be a good idea to also avoid a corner room. 
On the positive side, the room was decorated nicely and the bed was relatively comfortable ( the rooms had clearly been remodeled recently). I just wish the hotel would have invested additional money in insulation-soundproofing.",1,"traffic noise able hear room louder noise nyc hotel stay lifetime i've probably stay night nyc include short stint rent apartment city couple month guess noise bad give room rd floor situate corner overlook madison th could hear noise two different direction call front desk minute check room ask room high floor tell room available one th floor decline switch although retrospect might worth shot

Based on their impressive website, I expected their VIP program to be worth joining. I checked in and confirmed that my VIP # was in my reservation. The perks associated with the VIP program never materialized and the front desk girl was indifferent. I went up to my room to discover it was a handicap room. I wish the front desk person mentioned this when I was discussing room options with her. I try to stay at boutique hotels and I have come to expect the quirks that come with such hotels. The room was small but very stylish. The leather chair and ottoman along with the bed were extremely comfortable. The huge glass vase is dramatic but the grime on the inside takes away from the rest of the room. Some of the blinds were broken and the faux frosting on the bathroom door was marred.

13128,"My priorities for our stay in Chicago were for the hotel to be downtown, as inexpensive as possible while still being clean. The Essex pretty much matched these expectations.
We booked our hotel through a travel agent who used a -rd party hotel wholesale company. We got a great weekend rate of $----night including tax, which is about $----night before taxes. Parking would have been an additional $---night, but we parked in a public lot around the corner from the hotel for $---night. Also, parking at some meters on the street is free after -pm on Saturdays and all day Sunday.
Since we booked through the wholesale company, it was not possible to confirm a nonsmoking room (as a former travel agent, I know this is common practice). And since we checked in at -pm on a Friday night, the hotel was fully booked and there were only smoking rooms left. The room was very smoky smelling, as was the entire floor as soon as the elevator doors opened. The desk staff was gracious in finding us a different (though still smoking) room for Friday night and then moving us to a non smoking room for Saturday night. 
We had a room with - queen beds, which are really - full-sized beds. My husband and I sleep in a queen bed at home, but slept in separate beds at the Essex because there's no way we would have been comfortable in one bed. But the sheets were clean and the beds were comfy. The bathroom was clean, but not exactly gleaming, due to its need for updating and refurbishing. 
We did not use the pool or sauna, but only because we were out and about much of the time.
Overall, this is a decent, no-frills hotel if you don't want to break the bank to be in downtown Chicago. The desk staff was courteous and the bellman was very friendly and helpful in directing us to public transportation.
We spent much of our time at the funky bars and restaurants in the Lincoln Park area, which is probably where I would stay on future trips. But it was nice to be close to the impressive Grant park and the excitement and bustle of Michigan Ave. Also a good location to explore the museums and Navy Pier.",1,"priority stay chicago hotel downtown inexpensive possible still clean essex pretty much match expectations.

12740,"I have stayed at this hotel three times in a year, and I stay at Kimptons ---- times a year. The hotel isn't in the best or most central neighborhood and it's immediate surroundings have all of the charm of a car dealership (there is one across the street and one next door). But the hotel is new, has spacious rooms for NYC and knockout views.
This trip I had the worst front desk check in experience I've ever had. If it wasn't so rude it would have been like a skit from SNL. The staffer let me stand there at -- pm while she prattled on for - or -- minutes about the local club scene to another guest. Fine, and nice for the would-be clubber, except she seemed to think that it was OK to ignore her basic job which was to check-in guests. She could have taken a breath and got me up to my room in -- seconds but clearly just loved to talk clubs. Not the welcoming or professional experience one expects at any hotel.
The bathroom in my deluxe room had a very strong mildew smell. Why housekeeping didn't take it off line to address is not too clear, but if they don't maintain their nice new rooms they don't deserve the reviews others and I would otherwise give them. When I mentioned it they did to their credit comp a dining charge without being asked to do so.
About room service...They also charge absurdly for room service breakfast....-- bucks for an American breakfast plus -- percent tip plus - service charge...nearly -- bucks for eggs and bacon, coffee. Seriously, even in NYC that's crazy for a hotel in this category.
I love Kimpton's and usually have good experiences, here too. But they need to pick up their game at Ink -- if they want to maintain their clientele looking for a four star hotel

5707,"We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge last week (--------) for four nights and really loved our time there. The rooms are basic and rather small but they have everything you need and are perfect especially if you don't really intend to spend much of your time there as we didn't. The rooms were checked daily and beds were made and clean towels left. The guys on reception were helpful but let you get on with your stay too, and I felt safe and secure there. 
 We also liked Chelsea which is a great place to kickstart your trip from as there are lots of shops and bars and cafes nearby as well as the subway which links you to uptown and downtown areas really quickly.
I would definitely reccomend this to a friend.",0,"stay chelsea lodge last week four night really love time room basic rather small everything need perfect especially really intend spend much time room check daily bed make clean towel leave guys reception helpful let get stay felt safe secure

The price was highly overpriced for such a small room (I say small because I am comparing it to other hotels in NYC that I have previously stayed at). The breakfast area was ALWAYS crowded and it was hard to find an open table each day. We were only there for - nights, and there was only - day that there was a free table for the three of us at breakfast time. We were usually at breakfast around -:--am, and considering the breakfast is only served from ----am, you would have thought it wouldn't have been that busy. This hotel only has about --- rooms (maybe ---) so it isn't that big. It the morning, the normal wait for the elevator was -+ minutes, so we ususally took the stairs to our -th floor room. They only had - computer in the lower level and it was being used --% of the time. Probably because it gave you free internet usage and a printer to use, also.
